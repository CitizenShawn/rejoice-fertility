It threw me out of the passenger side window, and then the truck rolled over me and you could imagine it was a pretty hard hit. So I'm just happy to be alive, really.

But it was just a couple of months in when you came to me, and you were like, you know, I was praying, and I don't know that I ever prayed and asked God about what is his timing for our family?"

It's honestly hard to find clinics that offer it, and I'm sure you know, but for anybody that's listening, it's an approach that creates a lot fewer embryos. And you could do natural cycle where you just create one, or you could try to transfer just two or three. And what I gathered from Southeastern was that they were a pro life organization."

It's hard to really explain 100% exactly what this consent is, what you're consenting to, and what all the background stuff is. And I know sometimes if you have a doctor who, if there's an emergency situation, he's going to perform whatever he has to do, and there's not always a great amount of time to go and explain to someone informed consent and then come back and do what is in best interest. So we wanted someone who, for all of those reasons, someone who is operating with a worldview of having Life is sacred. Yeah, life is sacred. It begins at conception."

But just because you believe hard enough that it's going to happen, that's not faith. Our faith is in Christ alone and his accomplishment and what his will for our life is, which we don't know what it is exactly. We don't know if it's going to be to have no kids. One, two, three, who knows? And so our faith is in whatever it is that he has for us."

And we've heard stories of miraculous conceptions, some people that were led to adoption, some people that heard about Southeastern and NEDC from our show and went and now have snowflake babies. So God doesn't seem to work the same way twice. So just being a host on the show has just really showed me having courage to hope, because when you have so much hurt and so much expectation that's not met. It's scary to hope. But just knowing that God is good and that you can trust that whatever his plan is for you, it is going to be good and you can lean into that. And thank you for mentioning the show. It's been so much fun. We've put this guy on."

He wasn’t sure he could have children, or even whether he wanted to. But his wife Kendra felt the call to motherhood. And together, through Mini-Stim IVF, they discovered there is hope for spinal cord victims to become biological parents. They also learned that when God demolishes your dreams (and, in Eric’s case, fears as well), He’s ultimately bringing blessing, not devastation.  </p><p>Eric &amp; Kendra (and their daughter Eliana!) share their story in this episode of Hope, Faith, &amp; Infertility. Here's the link: <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://youtu.be/SQVze7VbGJE?si=3QM-7otZYXs6WgQL\">https://youtu.be/SQVze7VbGJE?si=3QM-7otZYXs6WgQL</a></p><p>Please rate, review, and subscribe wherever you listen to podcasts. </p><p><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://youtu.be/aAjprdWab7k?si=CzVWW1UrrkOAHns7Spread\"><strong><u><span style=\"color: rgb(13, 13, 13)\">A full transcript is below (Please note this transcript was done by AI and may contain factual &amp; grammatical errors):</span></u></strong></a></p><p><strong><br>00:01</strong><br>Mark Mellinger<br>Well, there is hope for people who have spinal cord injuries when it comes to having children, and my guests today are living proof. Eric and Kendra Knox are with me here on hope, faith and Infertility, a podcast of Southeastern fertility in Knoxville, Tennessee. And their story is full of hope, encouragement, and definitely faith. So let's start here. Eric, we've had your wife on before. We haven't had you on before. I'm glad to have both of you here. So tell me about your spinal cord injury, how it happened and how it changed your life.</p><p><strong><br>00:35</strong><br>Eric Knox<br>Yeah, I was 15 years old and I was with a bunch of friends. We were in a big field that it was actually dug out for making a lake, but there had been no rain. And so were out there, boys being boys, doing donuts and throwing a ton of dust in the air and all that kind of fun stuff. And I was with a friend of mine riding shotgun, and we flipped the truck. It threw me out of the passenger side window, and then the truck rolled over me and you could imagine it was a pretty hard hit. So I'm just happy to be alive, really. But, yeah, I was conscious through the whole thing. It rolled over me right at the belly button area and so immediately just paralyzed me from the waist down or, well, from the belly button down.</p><p><strong><br>01:25</strong><br>Eric Knox<br>And man, I actually leaned up like I was going to walk away from it. Like I said, I was fully conscious. I wasn't in any pain or anything like that. But I just realized that I couldn't move my legs. And everyone got pretty freaked out after that and we called an ambulance and it wasn't anything immediately that I thought was going to define the rest of my life. I thought it was going to be, I would get stuff back and then get back to life as usual, but that was not the case. But I've had a spinal cord injury, I'm a T ten paraplegic and have been so now for about 20 years.</p><p><strong><br>02:02</strong><br>Mark Mellinger<br>Wow, interesting. You do remember it all. You weren't unconscious during this and you don't remember any pain?</p><p><strong><br>02:12</strong><br>Eric Knox<br>There was no pain immediately. Initially, it was that huge surge of adrenaline that happeNed. I remember that. You ever get hit in the face with something and there's that immediately spike of adrenaline, but then, you know, like 5 seconds later you're waiting. You're like, man, it's about to start hurting. I know it. And I remember waiting for that pain to come, and it just didn't come. And because it cut off all sensation below the entry level, so I wasn't able to feel it. But after probably a couple of hours, I started realizing that my back was starting to ache, in which case it had been completely broken. I mean, the spine was just at about a 45 degree angle from where it was supposed to be.</p><p><strong><br>02:57</strong><br>Eric Knox<br>And so they had to do a stabilization surgery and put rods and nuts and bolts and all that type of stuff.</p><p><strong><br>03:03</strong><br>Kendra Knox<br>How many hours of surgery?</p><p><strong><br>03:04</strong><br>Eric Knox<br>I don't even know. I mean, it was several hours. The doctor told me that he was picking bone fragments out for several hours after that. It was a pretty traumatic event, but I'm happy to be here.</p><p><strong><br>03:19</strong><br>Mark Mellinger<br>Yeah, absolutely. And your wife is great. I mean, God has really blessed you guys, and we'll talk about your daughter very soon, too. She's a huge reason that you're here. When you guys met Kendra, you said having kids. I mean, not the first meeting, but I mean, early on in your relationship, you had made it clear to Eric that having kids was obviously, you know, having this sort of an injury really complicates things. So you did run into a lot of roadblocks, as a lot of couples will. How discouraging was that for each of you?</p><p><strong><br>04:03</strong><br>Kendra Knox<br>Yeah. Well, just to clarify, I was open to if God would build our family a different way through adoption or I knew that your injury level, because you were very honest from the beginning that we didn't know. It was a big question mark about if kids would be possible and if they were, there was a decent chance that we would need fertility treatments. Just as you're evaluating a life partner and you're like, what are the things that I feel called to? I felt like I'm called to be a mom. That's something in my heart that I don't think is going to go away. So just Having some initial conversations where you were not all on board about kids.</p><p><strong><br>04:48</strong><br>Mark Mellinger<br>So you weren't sure you wanted to have kids?</p><p><strong><br>04:51</strong><br>Eric Knox<br>No. Well, I have a disability, and I also work with kids who have disabilities, and I see the weight that carries on the parents. And I was just like, you know, a surefire way to get around that is to just not have kids. And I had two nieces at the time. Love them to death. But I just thought, man, having kids is going to be a big hassle, and I have a disability, so it's going to even be even more of a difficulty. And I was just like, you know what? Life is just going to be a lot easier if we just don't have kids, and I don't really care to have them. And a lot of that was some fear of, like, man, nobody wants to have a kid with a disability.</p><p><strong><br>05:38</strong><br>Kendra Knox<br>And parenting from a wheelchair is scary.</p><p><strong><br>05:41</strong><br>Eric Knox<br>Yeah. In the end of it, too, you're thinking, man, what if? I don't know how many times I've seen a kid run out to the road and a parent quickly chase them down, and I'm like, I can't do that. I can get to them in some situations, but if that kid, something happens to them because of, I wasn't able to get there quick enough. Am I ever going to be able to forgive myself? I don't know. And really just like, the root of it was a lot of fear. And I just knew. I just kept coming back to like, man, the way around that is just don't have kids and I'll be just fine.</p><p><strong><br>06:15</strong><br>Mark Mellinger<br>By the way, that line of thinking does make a lot of sense. I mean, I get it. It's very logical, very much linear thinking. How did the two of you navigate this? Because the problem is that you're dating a young woman who's like, I am definitely called to be a mom. There's no doubt about that. So how did you navigate this? And if there weren't, please tell me. But were there deep conversations with God about this? I'm interested in hearing all that.</p><p><strong><br>06:49</strong><br>Eric Knox<br>Oh, absolutely. I mean, several deep conversations about that. But she made it clear, like, I am going to be a mother. That's something that she was definitely called to, was in her heart, and was like you said, it was a non negotiable thing. And so I had to really revisit the idea of having kids when I.</p><p><strong><br>07:10</strong><br>Kendra Knox<br>Was, at this point, ready to cut and run, because I was know, I want somebody who not just wants kids, but has a passion for being a father and being a leader in the home and all of these things that are on my list. And it really was the Holy Spirit who told me to just be still and wait and allow God to work on Eric's heart. And I just started praying, and I'm surprised I didn't.</p><p><strong><br>07:34</strong><br>Eric Knox<br>Oh, I am too. Look, when I told her, when the whole thing of kids came up and I was like, you know, I don't really want kids. I mean, I saw it in her eyes immediately was like, oh, gosh, this is the deal breaker. And I was like, man, I just lost her.</p><p><strong><br>07:49</strong><br>Kendra Knox<br>We felt like God led us to enter a relationship, and so there's this moment where you're like, god, you've led us this far. And Eric was the first real, know, committed dating person that I'd ever had in my life. And so, like, this whole history of waiting for hi, baby. And so when he's on the scene, I'm like, God wouldn't lead us this far and then just leave us. So anyways, were talking one day and I think I brought up the fear thing you did a little bit and was like, Eric, just, is there any way that you're not trusting God? I was like, have you prayed and asked God if you're called to be a dad? And I really felt like there was something holding him back.</p><p><strong><br>08:31</strong><br>Kendra Knox<br>And I remember that you shared with me about the disability, you said, and you just teared up and you were like, I can't be the dad that goes in the backyard and throws a baseball around with my kids. What does that even look like? And I remember looking at you and telling you that as a parent, the most important thing for me isn't that my husband can go play ball with them in the backyard, but that he has a heart that is so in love with Jesus. And just as a dad that any kids that would come into our family would see that you had gone to the pit to the worst day possible. And somehow God's grace was enough to get you through it.</p><p><strong><br>09:15</strong><br>Kendra Knox<br>And I was like, that's the man that I want to be the father of my children, however God brings them in. And I knew from the beginning he's going to be good at it. We just had to get you to believe it, too.</p><p><strong><br>09:28</strong><br>Mark Mellinger<br>And was that where your heart was, Eric? I mean, basically you were following after Christ hard, but there was just this fear lodged in you for those legitimate reasons.</p><p><strong><br>09:39</strong><br>Eric Knox<br>Absolutely. Yeah. At the heart of it was, again, a human being taking power into his own hands, not trusting the father with what he knows is best. And I did. I took that power into my own hands and I said, however much I love God, you can't make me have kids. I'm going to just not do it and I'll skirt this whole issue and still serve you. But at the heart of that was me and my ability to take control of this situation. And I wasn't trusting him because I had some fears there. I can't go in the back and play baseball with the kids and stuff like that. It's going to be different, though. Just about anything that I want to do, I can make a way to do it, but it's just very different.</p><p><strong><br>10:37</strong><br>Eric Knox<br>But then having to figure out how to incorporate kids into that is going to be a whole nother issue, which is just a lot of it was that. But also just. I don't know. I had a fear that really wasn't based in logic, where I just always felt like, man, if I have a kid, they're going to end up having a disability, too, and how do I.</p><p><strong><br>11:01</strong><br>Kendra Knox<br>Take care of them?</p><p><strong><br>11:02</strong><br>Eric Knox<br>Yeah, I got to take care of me and my disability and this kid, and it's just going to be too much. And so that was just one of those illogical fears. Like, there's no scientific evidence that suggests that people with disabilities are at increased risk of having kids with disabilities.</p><p><strong><br>11:19</strong><br>Kendra Knox<br>And, of course, you know that if you did have a kid with a disability, God would give you the strength to get through it. Now, that fear of, what does this look like? Yeah.</p><p><strong><br>11:27</strong><br>Mark Mellinger<br>Amen. Amen.</p><p><strong><br>11:29</strong><br>Kendra Knox<br>I will say this. We did come full circle, because by the time I said I do, you had opened your heart to that idea, and it still was a process. I think when we got married were like, okay, I'm on board. Like, God has dealt with me on this. I'm on board for kids, but wait a year to get started. And then it was like, so we got married, and I was like, okay, we're a little older in life, so I thought, like, okay, the clock is ticking. Don't wait too long here. But it was just a couple of months in when you came to me, and you were like, you know, I was praying, and I don't know that I ever prayed and asked God about what is his timing for our family?</p><p><strong><br>12:09</strong><br>Kendra Knox<br>And because we knew that it might take a lot longer for us to figure out God's plan, we decided to go ahead and start on that journey.</p><p><strong><br>12:18</strong><br>Mark Mellinger<br>And how long have you guys been married now?</p><p><strong><br>12:20</strong><br>Kendra Knox<br>Five years.</p><p><strong><br>12:22</strong><br>Mark Mellinger<br>Five years. All right, congratulations.</p><p><strong><br>12:24</strong><br>Kendra Knox<br>Bragging rights. Once you get to five years, right?</p><p><strong><br>12:26</strong><br>Eric Knox<br>Yeah. Before five years, everybody be like, you're newlywed. Hey, we got a tiny little bit of street credit right now. We've been together for five years. We've not even mentioned the word divorce. I feel like we're doing all right.</p><p><strong><br>12:43</strong><br>Mark Mellinger<br>Yeah, no, that's great. I love hearing it. And when you did pursue parenthood, and we'll bring your daughter, Eliana, on here in just a few minutes. She's adorable. We've had a chance to meet her, which is awesome. So we'll see her soon. But your road was. We don't have to go into it all, but it's like, there were a lot of roadblocks, a lot of steps, a lot of things you tried, a lot of heartbreak. So it probably was a very good thing that you started early. On. There may be a lesson there. You eventually did find Southeastern fertility, and it was really the minimal stimulation, IVF, mini stem, IVF for short, that was compelling. Why did that seem appealing to the two of you?</p><p><strong><br>13:33</strong><br>Kendra Knox<br>Well, we had talked about, like, in our pursuit to have children, we're not going to put our faith and our beliefs aside just because we do have this passion. And when we looked at some of the typical IVF protocols, there's often a lot of embryos that are created with no plan for how to use them, and we believe life begins at conception. So were like, not having a plan is not an option for us, and we can't set aside our pro life beliefs just because we want this child. So we initially thought IVF was just off the table in general, because we didn't know a whole lot about the options and ways of doing it. And so we kind of pursued some other means.</p><p><strong><br>14:15</strong><br>Kendra Knox<br>And then when we kind of came to a halt at one point where were told, your last chance is IVF, I really had to deal on my heart at that point with, like, all right, is this the end of our biological child journey? And is God enough for me if we're called to this? But I was listening to a podcast, and somebody mentioned mini IVF, which I'd never heard of, and a lot of clinics don't talk about it. It's honestly hard to find clinics that offer it, and I'm sure you know, but for anybody that's listening, it's an approach that creates a lot fewer embryos. And you could do natural cycle where you just create one, or you could try to transfer just two or three. And what I gathered from Southeastern was that they were a pro life organization.</p><p><strong><br>15:02</strong><br>Kendra Knox<br>You're a non discard facility, which immediately gave a lot of peace to us, because when you don't know the medical world, it's hard to have that trust of, like, what exactly are you doing? And break it down to our level so that we really understand.</p><p><strong><br>15:16</strong><br>Eric Knox<br>Yeah, well, for one thing, I'm in the medical field, and so I already know when you're talking to patients, you're attempting to give informed consent in a lot of different areas, but this individual doesn't have a medical background at all. It's hard to really explain 100% exactly what this consent is, what you're consenting to, and what all the background stuff is. And I know sometimes if you have a doctor who, if there's an emergency situation, he's going to perform whatever he has to do, and there's not always a great amount of time to go and explain to someone informed consent and then come back and do what is in best interest. So we wanted someone who, for all of those reasons, someone who is operating with a worldview of having Life is sacred. Yeah, life is sacred. It begins at conception.</p><p><strong><br>16:13</strong><br>Eric Knox<br>You have a Christian background of some sort, is what I would really love so that we don't have to worry about you in those behind the scenes efforts, is that we always know that you're operating with a worldview that says, this life is, even though it is an embryo right now, it's a human life, and I value it. And that's what we wanted.</p><p><strong><br>16:34</strong><br>Kendra Knox<br>We also love that Southeastern is partners with the NEDC. And so weren't sure if mini IVF was going to work for us, and we liked the idea of already being familiar with this clinic. So if the Lord leads us to Snowflake adoption, that we know the people. And it seemed like a nice fit to have that feature as well, even though it was 6 hours away from us in Knoxville.</p><p><strong><br>17:00</strong><br>Mark Mellinger<br>Yeah, you guys are all the way in Mississippi, and we're in Knoxville. Whether you do Southeastern fertility or the National Embryo Donation center, each place, you're going to have to travel here to Knoxville. That's the one thing that's different. But you guys were willing to do it. So glad that you did. And I know we had Kendra on a couple of years ago, and the success was not immediate. Even here with us, it was not easy. Did you ever doubt that it would actually work, that God would actually grant you a biological child, even through a careful fertility procedure like mini Stem IVF?</p><p><strong><br>17:46</strong><br>Eric Knox<br>I did.</p><p><strong><br>17:47</strong><br>Kendra Knox<br>Yeah. Well, I went into it not feeling that God had promised me anything. And I loved that. Your clinic was very honest about, like, these are the chances, and it's difficult to not get almost superstitious about chances and looking at percentages, and you get to the point where you just have to reason in your heart and say, God's going to do what God wants to do, and we need to be faithful if we feel him calling us to do a procedure. And what I did struggle with was we felt a lot of peace about trying it. We went, I think it was end of July into August and did our first cycle, and we both had really good feelings about it. We had a piece and ended up having a chemical pregnancy and super early miscarriage.</p><p><strong><br>18:38</strong><br>Kendra Knox<br>And so dealing with that, like, wow, there were two little embryos transferred, and were ready to welcome those kids into our lives and homes. And so mentally having to understand, I felt that God called us to this. So then why did it end this way? And the Lord really led me into a lot of the Psalms and just knowing that God is good, it sounds cliche, but it really is the Gospel. It is.</p><p><strong><br>19:09</strong><br>Mark Mellinger<br>Whatever you're going through now, someday your life will be great.</p><p><strong><br>19:12</strong><br>Kendra Knox<br>Yeah. And you look at David and he's looking at his enemies, and he's like, why are they flourishing? And I'm over here hiding in a cave, and I think we kind of felt like we're honoring you, Lord, in every area of our life. And why are these people getting pregnant and having babies? And if you look at, I think it's Psalm 72, David, when he complains about his enemies, he has this heart check in the middle of the chapter. And then he says, and then I came into the house of God, and it's like everything changes. And he realizes who God is and that he needs to regret his perspective. It was rough those first couple of days. You were a little salty at God for a minute.</p><p><strong><br>19:51</strong><br>Eric Knox<br>Oh, yeah. For having a spinal cord injury from the age of 15. At 15, your hopes and dreams are very different. You got all kinds of different stuff going, rolling around in your noggin. And I already know and have 100% experience God is not above demolishing your hopes and dreams because they don't factor into his plan for your life.</p><p><strong><br>20:14</strong><br>Kendra Knox<br>He has good plans. He has good than your plan.</p><p><strong><br>20:17</strong><br>Eric Knox<br>They're different than yours. And you're like, man, I know he's placed something in my wife that she has a nurturing motherliness about. And he had already, through prayer and time together and discussions with Kendra, had removed this seed of fear in my life and had moved me towards fatherhood. And I'm like, all right, you brought us here. Yeah, you took us right here, man. Like, what's your deal? And then you're like, okay, I've got to set aside my hopes and dreams of what I think our future is going to be like. And I told her, I was like, maybe we're supposed to be in our church. We're going to be moms and dads of kids who don't have great moms and dads in the church. You know what I mean? Sometimes you have to be kind of, what would you call it?</p><p><strong><br>21:15</strong><br>Kendra Knox<br>A step in parent?</p><p><strong><br>21:17</strong><br>Eric Knox<br>Kind of, yeah, kind of like a supplementary type parental figure to a person who said that. Because I'm like, there's a lot of single moms in churches that they don't have dads, and there's some who, they have moms, but they're not great moms. And so maybe that's what we're supposed to do is kind of be like supplemental parents to kids in our church. I don't know.</p><p><strong><br>21:38</strong><br>Kendra Knox<br>Again, the Holy Spirit was so good because he tells me this, and I'm, like, freaking out because, no, I'm not done trying. I really am. Not. Initially, you're just grieving. But I think it was like, by the next day, I was like, I don't think I had to. The Holy Spirit just kept me quiet. And it was just, I think, a week or two later, and you came to me on your own, and you were like, you know what? I think maybe we should try this one more time. And this time, when we tried, I approached the first time with a whole lot of positivity and peace, just to show you that our emotions mean nothing as far as success.</p><p><strong><br>22:14</strong><br>Kendra Knox<br>Yes, I approached the second trial with just dread and knowing this is not going to work, but I have to do it just to have peace in my mind. And, yeah, it was successful and shocked us both. I think were both thinking, like, this is kind of it. I don't know that we could endure another disappointment.</p><p><strong><br>22:39</strong><br>Eric Knox<br>Yeah.</p><p><strong><br>22:42</strong><br>Mark Mellinger<br>Well, I love it, and so many key points there, but a couple that are just really good to camp out on. Before we talk about Eliana, I want to underscore one. Emotions in this particular realm don't necessarily correlate to success. People need to know that. And I've talked, by the way, with a lot of people who were just like you, who came in, whether it's embryo adoption or IVF or whatever, they came in super pumped for the first One. It didn't work. They get down and then they temper the expectations, maybe even feel a little bit negative the second time around, and.</p><p><strong><br>23:21</strong><br>Kendra Knox<br>That'S when it gets hurt again. So I'm not going to hope this time.</p><p><strong><br>23:26</strong><br>Mark Mellinger<br>Yes, people do that. And you know what? They still have success. So, man, such an important point. And I also really liked what you said, Eric. Very memorable. God is not above demolishing your hopes and dreams. And that doesn't sound encouraging to people as believers, we don't want to hear that. But there's a song that says, you thought God was an architect. Now, you know, he's really like a pipe bomb ready to blow. And that is the truth. And it just reminds me that his dreams and plans for our lives are better than our dreams and plans for our lives. And as a Christian, it may take decades, but you have to get to that point. And that's where you, at 15 years old, I guarantee you didn't see yourself in this situation.</p><p><strong><br>24:23</strong><br>Eric Knox<br>No. All of those hopes and dreams that I had were not built on the foundation of Christ. They were built on the very wrong foundation, really?</p><p><strong><br>24:33</strong><br>Kendra Knox<br>Okay.</p><p><strong><br>24:33</strong><br>Eric Knox<br>And I was just going to say something that I wanted to add is a lot of times we mistake. In the world of Christianity, we mistake positivity for faith. Those are not like, man, if I believe hard enough, faith isn't believing something hard enough, even if it is like having kids is a very biblical thing. But just because you believe hard enough that it's going to happen, that's not faith. Our faith is in Christ alone and his accomplishment and what his will for our life is, which we don't know what it is exactly. We don't know if it's going to be to have no kids. One, two, three, who knows? And so our faith is in whatever it is that he has for us.</p><p><strong><br>25:16</strong><br>Kendra Knox<br>Just to balance all of that out. The goodness of God is very real.</p><p><strong><br>25:21</strong><br>Eric Knox<br>Absolutely.</p><p><strong><br>25:21</strong><br>Kendra Knox<br>And it's different than what we want. But for any believer who trusts in him, on the worst day, when we're dealing with finding out about the miscarriage, God's peace was there through that. And I don't know how unbelievers go through things like that without him. And there were so many moments throughout our whole journey that God gave us little, just glimmers of hope and who he is to kind of. Are you waving?</p><p><strong><br>25:48</strong><br>Mark Mellinger<br>I was going to say, and, yes, he does. He gives you those windows to help keep you going. So he's good in that respect. But for those of you who are watching the video version, you're seeing this beautiful little 16 month old, Eliana, who is their daughter, the result of their second transfer. And so we're going to talk about her a little bit again, beautiful little girl and a dream come true for you guys. So I want to hear about her. What's she like, and how has she changed your lives?</p><p><strong><br>26:22</strong><br>Kendra Knox<br>She's a Spitfire. Her name, first of all, Eliana Joy means God has answered because we had so many people praying for us, and joy because she brought us so much joy. And when were praying over her, when she was in the womb, I remember praying. We both got the word gentleness when were praying separately. Yeah, God's just calling us. I was praying the fruit of the spirit over my little tummy, and I prayed about gentleness, and I got three kicks, and it was the first time I felt her kick and I just thought, oh, the Lord's going to give us the most gentle child ever. It's a sign.</p><p><strong><br>26:58</strong><br>Eric Knox<br>And I was praying, too, and I was like, I don't know why, but I just feel like she's going to be a gentle soul. It was like that just resonated with me for some reason. And again, it was a feeling, so nothing that I can count on. But it was Od that both of us separately got the word gentle.</p><p><strong><br>27:16</strong><br>Kendra Knox<br>Well, and there's a scripture that says that a woman should have a gentle and quiet spirit, which is a great worth in sight. And I love that, because in today's culture, there's a lot of women that, of course, we have a voice, but you don't have to scream and shout and be rude. I wanted her to have a feminine spirit and the spirit that God created for her. And so we're praying gentleness. And, of course, this little one, she is a daredevil. She is one of the strongest little toddlers you have ever made. So I think God was preparing us. Okay, go ahead and start praying for gentleness.</p><p><strong><br>27:53</strong><br>Eric Knox<br>It was not an innate gentleness inside of her that God, maybe he was speaking to us, that. You guys are going to have to cultivate gentleness, this one, because she's not coming pre programmed with it. Keep that in the forefront of your mind.</p><p><strong><br>28:08</strong><br>Kendra Knox<br>It's a fruit of the spirit. And until she has the opportunity to choose Christ, that's how gentleness is being formed and created in her. But I will say she is one of the most determined little ones. And our prayer for her is, because I think we live in such a dark time, is that she will make her heart tender to the Holy Spirit and that she'll submit to him, but that she'll stand against corruption and evil and darkness and use that steadfast spirit to stand for righteousness. But we're just entering the cuddly phase, and we're starting to see the gentle come out. So that's been really nice.</p><p><strong><br>28:44</strong><br>Eric Knox<br>But one word that we choose to describe her quite often is we like to use the word passionate. She's very passionate about everything she does, and we like that word. That's the one that we've chosen to go with.</p><p><strong><br>29:00</strong><br>Mark Mellinger<br>I love it. I love. Well, hey, she's being totally sweet right now, just with Mama and her YouTube.</p><p><strong><br>29:09</strong><br>Kendra Knox<br>Channel, and she's watching elephants and ducks. Who say Doc? Who say Doc? Oh, elephant. You're doing the trunk.</p><p><strong><br>29:15</strong><br>Mark Mellinger<br>Oh, she's doing the trunk. Okay. I wondered why she. I thought she might just be pointing at the old man on the screen. But no, it's the elephant.</p><p><strong><br>29:24</strong><br>Kendra Knox<br>She does love to wave to everybody in Walmart and Kroger.</p><p><strong><br>29:27</strong><br>Mark Mellinger<br>She's got a great smile. It. I love it. And, Eric, have you found that some of the fears, as we move toward wrapping it up, the fears you had about, well, parenting will look a little different for me. Have you found that's been okay? Some of those things that you feared haven't been realized. You are able to do this more than you ever thought you would be able to.</p><p><strong><br>29:54</strong><br>Eric Knox<br>I guess I can say, so far so good.</p><p><strong><br>29:57</strong><br>Mark Mellinger<br>Yeah. A year and a half, right.</p><p><strong><br>29:58</strong><br>Kendra Knox<br>It's pretty early issue. And the just being a new dad.</p><p><strong><br>30:02</strong><br>Eric Knox<br>Yeah. I don't know if I can separate those two out, but it definitely is different just having to pick her up and she's down. She's up and she's down. And now that she's got two good legs underneath her, we don't have a very busy road. But there's always just that thought of, it's like a legitimate fear that you should have that you can't let your kid run out into the road. So I'm very vigilant about not letting her get close to the road or me staying between her or. I'm the dad who has the kid on the leash now.</p><p><strong><br>30:43</strong><br>Kendra Knox<br>We do. We bought a tether.</p><p><strong><br>30:45</strong><br>Eric Knox<br>Yeah.</p><p><strong><br>30:46</strong><br>Mark Mellinger<br>And why not?</p><p><strong><br>30:48</strong><br>Eric Knox<br>When you're as fast as you are, she's quick, too. So I just got to make sure that you really put a lot of forethought into planning for whatever you're going to go about your day and making sure that you have kind of safety in mind and all that type of stuff.</p><p><strong><br>31:03</strong><br>Kendra Knox<br>But you have adapted beautifully. I just have to say, I think other people at our church and just in the community watch you with her, and they're like, it looks like you haven't missed a beat.</p><p><strong><br>31:14</strong><br>Eric Knox<br>Well, all kids love going for a ride in a wheelchair, sitting in your lap. So all kids love that. I have random kids who will come up to me and climb up into my lap, like in Walmart, and they're just like, ride. All right, kid, let's go for a ride. Let's go find your mom and dad. Where they at?</p><p><strong><br>31:30</strong><br>Kendra Knox<br>Well, and just to emphasize how much we have enjoyed her, we're hoping to try again for another little one. So we'll be seeing you in a few months. We've been praying about a sibling for you to have. Yeah. Feel God's leading us to try again. So even though it's scary and we've been through it, we know what we're getting ourselves into. If the Lord calls you to this, he will equip you and he'll give you joy for the journey, too.</p><p><strong><br>32:04</strong><br>Mark Mellinger<br>He will. And, yeah, that's great, man. It would be great for you, too, to have another. Maybe that will be the gentle one. Or maybe you'll get two passionate kids.</p><p><strong><br>32:15</strong><br>Kendra Knox<br>Which is sleeper this time.</p><p><strong><br>32:20</strong><br>Mark Mellinger<br>Well, that was how it worked for us. Our daughter did not sleep at all, and then our son came a year and a half later, and we actually thought something was wrong with him. He was just a lump. The doctor's like, no, enjoy it. Yeah, maybe that'll be the case for you guys, too. So a couple last. You know, you are, for people who don't know, a radio host for American Family radio, you do a great show on there called Hannah's Heart where you're speaking to folks going through infertility from a. And, you know, you started out the show not being a mother a couple years ago, and now obviously you are. How has being a mother changed the way, if it has at all, that you approach your radio show? I don't know. Maybe it hasn't.</p><p><strong><br>33:12</strong><br>Kendra Knox<br>Yeah. Wow. Well, of course, you see just all the aspects of the goodness of God, and I think from a lot of the people that we've had on the program to share their story. One thing that I've come away with is that because I approached fertility with this, God doesn't owe me anything. This is the statistics in a very rational way. But we've got a little busy girl over here.</p><p><strong><br>33:36</strong><br>Eric Knox<br>No, that's fine.</p><p><strong><br>33:37</strong><br>Mark Mellinger<br>Eric can step out for a second.</p><p><strong><br>33:40</strong><br>Kendra Knox<br>God just showed me I can work however I want to work. And we've heard stories of miraculous conceptions, some people that were led to adoption, some people that heard about Southeastern and NEDC from our show and went and now have snowflake babies. So God doesn't seem to work the same way twice. So just being a host on the show has just really showed me having courage to hope, because when you have so much hurt and so much expectation that's not met. It's scary to hope. But just knowing that God is good and that you can trust that whatever his plan is for you, it is going to be good and you can lean into that. And thank you for mentioning the show. It's been so much fun. We've put this guy on.</p><p><strong><br>34:28</strong><br>Kendra Knox<br>We would love for any of your listeners to come join the Hannah's Heart family, and we'd love to pray for you guys while you're on your journey.</p><p><strong><br>34:35</strong><br>Mark Mellinger<br>Yeah. And it is a great show and you can find it at Hannah's Heart AFA on socials, and then you can find out how to listen there. It's on YouTube, so, yeah, it'll do your soul good. Definitely do it. Let's close with this. Do you all have any encouragement or advice, parting shots for other couples who are living with spinal cord injuries and sort of walking the same road that you did? Not sure what the future is going to look like, but want to have children?</p><p><strong><br>35:09</strong><br>Eric Knox<br>Yeah. Money is always a factor in this. Always. And so do your research. There's some simple, low cost options for you. And I would say start at the low cost option, try it, and then kind of work your way up. And that's what we did. And eventually we got to IVF, and that's really, like the only option. But do that maintain, like, pray together as a couple? That's what we still do. We pray together. We've already started praying over the second one. And wrap your minds around it might not happen. You don't know exactly what God's plan for your life is. And I know that sounds negative, but I have a spinal cord injury and I have more joy in my life than most able bodied people do.</p><p><strong><br>36:00</strong><br>Kendra Knox<br>You do.</p><p><strong><br>36:00</strong><br>Eric Knox<br>And it's because we go through the difficulty of when we pray to God, he already knows what your thoughts are. He knows what your fears are, so you might as well admit them to him. And you come in, you say, God, we want a kid and we want R1 bad, but we're scared it's not going to happen. And I have no clue what I'm going to do with myself if that's your answer, if your answer is like, no, kids aren't for you, or maybe it takes two or three tries and just be open with him, and it's very freeing to just admit that to him. He already knows it. And then a lot of times I think that might be what it is.</p><p><strong><br>36:37</strong><br>Eric Knox<br>You're just coming before him and just laying it all out there and letting him know, like, hey, I'm trusting you with this, and I'm going to be vulnerable with you about all of these fears that I have. And at the end of the day, I trust you with whatever your answer is, whether it's a kid on the first try, the third try, or moving on from IVF and trying adoption, or maybe some sort of an alternate means of parenthood and fatherhood, but do that together. Pray as a couple. And just lay it all out there before him and in front of each other, too.</p><p><strong><br>37:11</strong><br>Mark Mellinger<br>So good. Yeah. Then that's real prayer, too. I really appreciate that. And we will be praying for you two and actually you three as you come back here. So, Eric, Kendra, Eliana, my guest today. So appreciate your story and how God has worked in your life. And you're absolutely right. Whatever he has for you can trust him with the bigger picture and you are really living proof of that.

But kind of that first year, there was always this sense of, I think I would reason with myself, like, oh, sometimes it takes a year. And so kind of like, holding out with this hope of it would happen eventually. And then I remember once we hit the one year mark, went and saw my doctor to talk about it, and I think that's when it really sunk in, like, this is not happening.

We were kind of helping run a summer discipleship program for college students.

And I remember from that point on, there was no guarantee moving forward. It's like, okay, I really felt like God impressed this on my heart, but I don't know what's going to happen. But I knew he was very good. I just remember moving forward, just really believing, whatever happens, he's really good to us, and I can trust him.

And so that was kind of a turning point in just really telling a lot of our friends and family, like, we're walking through this, will you pray with us? And so it kind of became a journey since 2016 of just walking with our friends and family, them just kind of praying for us and just kind of engaging with how were doing in it.

Rachel, that is not a place that everybody who is encountering infertility gets to, or anybody who's going through any sort of major life trial gets to. But as a believer, I think you have to get to that place where you say, there is this thing that I want, and it seems like a good desire, and I want God to give it to me. I'm going to ask. My impression is that he also wants the same thing. And that's why I laughed a little bit when you were telling your story. Sometimes when Christians think God has spoken to them, that just can't be questioned in their minds. I know you're not saying it like that. You held it with a very open, humble hand. We can't always be sure our impressions from God are 100% correct, but nonetheless, that's what you felt, and it seemed to make sense, but yet you were willing to say if this never happened. \r"

So that passage ended up being read at our wedding and our officiate, his little sermonette, Rachel's older brother, was based on Isaiah 54. And I had always thought of that in a very again, almost like a paradigm for thinking about life. The specifics of being barren were not something that I anticipated once that became part of our story.

And so my way of dealing with difficult things in life is to kind of have a roll with the punches, mindset and attitude. Like, I know difficult things are going to happen. I'm not going to ignore or deny that they're difficult, but I'm not going to try to fight them or sort of overcome them. I'm just going to kind of accept this is how it is. And so when we started experiencing infertility, that was my very strong instinctive response.

So it was a very difficult thing for me, and I wanted it, but the pain of that, of not having what I want, it was just easier for me to resolve almost by just kind of resigning myself to it.

We would have all these people that were waiting with us, and then we had to be the bearers of bad news to them.

And for some reason, IVF just felt pretty daunting and scary. So it's like even when we started pursuing IUIs, I remember my OB. I think after the second IUI, she said, hey, just be thinking about IVF. So what we did is we did our third IUI. It was summer of 2022, and then went on a big road trip. So we had kind of space a couple of months to really just process like, do we want to go for a fourth IUI? Should we think about seeing a fertility specialist? And so we kind of decided, let's just move forward with both. So we kind of moved forward with doing the fourth IUI, which resulted not working. \r"

We just felt this sense of we couldn't work with that fertility specialist. I think then it kind of felt a little overwhelming, like, well, how could we do this in a way that feels like is right based on what we believe?

Even if it doesn't make sense, and even if it feels terrifying, you will follow me because you'll believe I'm only going to write a good story.

It was like something and I'm using this word very intentionally, it was like he was birthing something in me, like a level of submission that felt almost deeper than there's just a very few moments in my life that I could say I felt like that level of like, okay, God, I submit to you.

Regardless of whether this ends in children, you are doing something deeply significant in our lives and deeply good in our lives. And I'm experiencing that, like I said, in the context of this community of people, that it felt like he had raised up that were praying for us.

I've been so spoiled that I can send my nurse an email, and she'll just email me within a few hours. So there's just this level of it's just very personal. I don't know how to describe it. And there's just a level of care. And I just really appreciate just how just even with Dr. Gordon just being like a follower of Jesus, and it's like, well, what other clinic can you go to?

And yet I would say most of us spend our lives negotiating for a different story. We don't like the one we're in. We don't want to play the role that he's uniquely given us to play. And that's just a constant battle. But I love how you guys have given us a window into how he shaped your thinking to say, I'm going to run the race he has for me, I'm not going to run the race he has for somebody else that I wish were my race. That's just a place you have to get to in the Christian life if you're going to grow in your relationship with God. \r"

Probably everybody's like this, but I want to anticipate the possible disappointments in part, so I can protect myself against the pain because the shock of pain feels worse than predicted pain, right? Yeah, I felt that, too. But again, if I was to kind of try to capture my sense of even when went to our initial ultrasounds, because it's like we had one at six and a half weeks, eight weeks, nine weeks, so we had a bunch in a row.

A long, infertility journey as well, almost a decade. Rachel and roland mays are my guests here on the hope faith and infertility podcast, coming to you from southeastern fertility in knoxville, tennessee. Southeastern <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"http://fertility.org\">fertility.org</a>. For more information, I'm mark Mellinger, your host. So let's start here. Talk about when you two got married was infertility a thought for you back then. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>00:39\r</p><p>Rachel Mayes\r</p><p>So I think when we first got know, based on my personality, I kind of always imagined worst case scenarios because we had been married for about four years when we started trying to get pregnant. And I remember there was that thought that crossed into my head about, what if it takes a long time or what if we can't? And so I'm just going to keep sharing my journey. But kind of that first year, there was always this sense of, I think I would reason with myself, like, oh, sometimes it takes a year. And so kind of like, holding out with this hope of it would happen eventually. And then I remember once we hit the one year mark, went and saw my doctor to talk about it, and I think that's when it really sunk in, like, this is not happening. And I know for me, I can struggle with wanting control, and I have more of, like, anxious personality. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>01:51\r</p><p>Rachel Mayes\r</p><p>And so there was kind of this dynamic in me coming out of I was very fearful and had this desire to kind of try and like, okay, well, let's just control things. Let's figure it out. Let's make it happen. And so let me see. We went to see my doctor, and then she recommended us to see a fertility specialist, and then we kind of went to one locally and kind of started pursuing fertility treatment. And then kind of what happened is I think we both realized weren't really on the same page. I think I kind of realized I was kind of doing this out of control anxiety. And I know roland can kind of share where he was at in a few minutes, but I remember kind of hitting this point of realizing we just didn't feel peace to keep going in pursuing fertility treatment, and so we kind of just paused on that. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>02:55\r</p><p>Rachel Mayes\r</p><p>So this is back in 2015. So it was like about a year into our journey, and I think at that point, I kind of really went through just a season of deep grief and mourning and kind of like asking those questions like, god, where are you? I really struggled feeling abandoned. So I think what was actually happening is it was actually god's kindness was probably just revealing some deeper questions I had towards god of like, wait, does he see me? Is he with me? And so kind of like 2015 to 2016 was kind of a year of really wrestling with the Lord and kind of, I think just like, grieving and just feeling just the pain of, like, this is not happening. I think also in that season in our church, in our community, we probably saw there's probably at least five couples that were peers with us all get pregnant, and then we're just kind of here, like, okay, this is not happening. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>04:02\r</p><p>Rachel Mayes\r</p><p>We don't know what. And I think in that space, I really struggled feeling pretty isolated. If you've walked through infertility, you kind of understand there's, like, something about it that you feel really ashamed if you haven't gone through. It's hard to understand, but there's something that I don't know what it is, but I know I really struggled feeling, like, a sense of shame and, like, a loneliness and isolation and kind of what happened was in the summer of 2016. So now we're two years into kind of just this road, and were actually spending the summer in Colorado with kind of part of our jobs. We were kind of helping run a summer discipleship program for college students. And I remember getting to a point in my relationship with God where I just kind of came to a point of surrender, of just really asking Him if this is not going to happen, if this is something we need to let go, can you just tell us? \r</p><p>\r</p><p>05:14\r</p><p>Rachel Mayes\r</p><p>I think kind of just coming to that point of like, yeah, if we need to let this go, I'll do it. And kind of through it's kind of hard to explain, but just through just different things that happened. I really felt this sense in my heart, like, just this impression from God. He was basically encouraging me to not stop asking for it. And I kind of really felt like he told us that we would have biological children, which is kind of a scary thing of like, wait, how do you learn that? And then how do you walk that out? But I really felt like almost like he was saying, I want you to keep asking. Like, don't stop hoping for it. And I think in that moment and there were other things that happened where I don't know how to explain it, but I think I really just had just this moment or just series of moments of understanding and really believing. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>06:19\r</p><p>Rachel Mayes\r</p><p>Like, wait, god was with me in it that I struggled to feel like forgotten, but for somehow I knew deep down he was with us. He saw us. He was doing something. We couldn't understand what was happening, but he was moving in it. And I just remember that just totally changed the game for me. And I remember from that point on, there was no guarantee moving forward. It's like, okay, I really felt like God impressed this on my heart, but I don't know what's going to happen. But I knew he was very good. I just remember moving forward, just really believing, whatever happens, he's really good to us, and I can trust him. And so then it became this, I think, a journey of what does it mean to kind of, I think, persevere in prayer. I came back from that summer kind of with two things, this sense of to keep praying for it. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>07:23\r</p><p>Rachel Mayes\r</p><p>And then I also really felt this sense of wanting to just invite people into this journey with us. I really felt like God was calling me to radical vulnerability and transparency, I think, out of this place of just feeling like, man, I don't want to let this isolate me and Roland. And so that was kind of a turning point in just really telling a lot of our friends and family, like, we're walking through this, will you pray with us? And so it kind of became a journey since 2016 of just walking with our friends and family, them just kind of praying for us and just kind of engaging with how were doing in it. And I think there's this tension in my heart of really praying boldly and continue to persevere and at the same time be really surrendered in it because there was no guarantee. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>08:25\r</p><p>Rachel Mayes\r</p><p>Even though I kind of felt this sense like this was what God was calling us to do. It's like, well, it could not happen. I could be wrong. And coming to a point of if I was wrong or if we never have children, it's okay. Like, coming to a place of really being able to believe and see that, okay, God is like, enough for us. He's going to take care of us. He's like the real reward in this life. And so in that there was kind of this freedom of like, man, I'm going to go for it and be bold with the Lord and continuing to ask and believe, but then also be content with kind of where were at. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>09:08\r</p><p>Mark Mellinger\r</p><p>And that is, I think, really instructive. Rachel, that is not a place that everybody who is encountering infertility gets to, or anybody who's going through any sort of major life trial gets to. But as a believer, I think you have to get to that place where you say, there is this thing that I want, and it seems like a good desire, and I want God to give it to me. I'm going to ask. My impression is that he also wants the same thing. And that's why I laughed a little bit when you were telling your story. Sometimes when Christians think God has spoken to them, that just can't be questioned in their minds. I know you're not saying it like that. You held it with a very open, humble hand. We can't always be sure our impressions from God are 100% correct, but nonetheless, that's what you felt, and it seemed to make sense, but yet you were willing to say if this never happened. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>10:09\r</p><p>Mark Mellinger\r</p><p>I can put it on the cross and I can accept somehow, as hard as it seems, that what God has for me is better for me. Ultimately. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>10:18\r</p><p>Rachel Mayes\r</p><p>Yes. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>10:22\r</p><p>Mark Mellinger\r</p><p>And I love how you said he's the reward, the relationship with him is the reward. And I want to dive into that a little bit later because that's also a truth that a lot of Christians are eluded by, and we all can be there sometimes when life wears us down. But Roland, I'm interested in hearing from your perspective. She mentioned that you guys were on different pages at first. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>10:46\r</p><p>Rollin Mayes\r</p><p>Yeah, well, it's interesting, I didn't think about this coming into this podcast, but when you asked us that question, my mind actually went back all the way to 2008, which is when Rachel and I met, and we met as students at the same summer discipleship program that she referenced in 2016. That later in 2016, were staffing in the context of our college ministry. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>11:10\r</p><p>Mark Mellinger\r</p><p>I should mention, by the way, that you guys do college ministry down in Texas. I said at the beginning, you came from several states away, I didn't say where. So Texas. Yeah. Nobody loves their state like a Texan. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>11:22\r</p><p>Rollin Mayes\r</p><p>Yeah, that's right. What's really crazy in our story is that the first serious conversation that Rachel and I ever had was centered around Isaiah 54. And I was really obsessed with Isaiah 54 at that time. And the first line of Isaiah 54 is, sing, o barren woman, says sing, obarren woman, who has not born. And then there's just this incredible series of promises out of that. It's like, for the children of the desolate, one will be more than the children of her, who is, you know, God was speaking that to the nation of the even specifically, like the city of Jerusalem, which was like this mother of the family of God that had yeah, desolated as a result of the exile and sin. Well, really, as a student, what had caught my heart with that passage was this idea that God was saying basically to sing out of the very place where you feel cursed and lost. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>12:36\r</p><p>Rollin Mayes\r</p><p>And I remember talking Rachel's ear off about that because that idea is like a paradigm for life. Like, how can I take the area where I feel cursed or lost and respond to it by breaking forth and joyful singing? That's what the Isaiah 54, it's like a command. Sing obaran woman. So that passage ended up being read at our wedding and our officiate, his little sermonette, Rachel's older brother, was based on Isaiah 54. And I had always thought of that in a very again, almost like a paradigm for thinking about life. The specifics of being barren were not something that I anticipated once that became part of our story. Actually, that passage at times to me felt almost like a cruel irony, like a trick that God had played on us that we'd kind of been brought together because we would still say it's like it's in some ways our passage. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>13:42\r</p><p>Rollin Mayes\r</p><p>It's a very significant thing, even the context of our marriage, and I really wrestled with that, of my sense of the character of God and the goodness of God, almost like, did you set us up for this? Whereas Rachel, she mentioned that her tendency might be toward control, mine can be toward passivity. And so my way of dealing with difficult things in life is to kind of have a roll with the punches, mindset and attitude. Like, I know difficult things are going to happen. I'm not going to ignore or deny that they're difficult, but I'm not going to try to fight them or sort of overcome them. I'm just going to kind of accept this is how it is. And so when we started experiencing infertility, that was my very strong instinctive response. It was painful and scary, but for me, the easiest way to deal with that was just to kind of say, okay, this is just reality. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>14:43\r</p><p>Rollin Mayes\r</p><p>Let's not fight it. And Rachel described how went through this process of kind of starting to pursue taking some initial steps towards getting help with fertility. And what ended up stopping us is that I came to a point where I realized, wait, I'm not actually present in this. I'm almost just doing this because Rachel wants to do it. And it's not coming out of a unified place in our marriage where we're together feeling a sense before the Lord of like, yes, this is what we want to do. We have freedom to do, or he's inviting us to do it, however you want to phrase it. I just realized I was just kind of along for the ride and that was wrong. I couldn't just be along for the ride. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>15:23\r</p><p>Mark Mellinger\r</p><p>So freeze it for just a second. I want to stop you. You can continue in a second because I want to hear it, but I just want to camp out on this for a second. Infertility is so hard on marriages, and I'm trying to envision this in my mind's eye. Did this cause first of all, you're trying to be a good husband, and you've got a wife who's very concerned about this, so you got to hold that at the same time, you're not feeling what she's feeling. Like, you said you didn't feel like you were a part of it. This was her dream, not yours. I'm putting words in your mouth, but something to that effect. Did this cause significant conflict in your marriage? \r</p><p>\r</p><p>16:05\r</p><p>Rollin Mayes\r</p><p>Well, I think it's kind of interesting. It's almost like because I chose to be passive, it was more of like conflict avoidant than conflict engaged. It was like I deeply wanted to be a father. I mean, I had felt that desire. I remember in high school, I would say this thing like, I remember telling my parents, I want to have four to eight kids. I remember that particular thing, which is kind of an embarrassing thing to even share in this context, but it's like, I love that idea of being a father. So it was a very difficult thing for me, and I wanted it, but the pain of that, of not having what I want, it was just easier for me to resolve almost by just kind of resigning myself to it. Like, this is just the way it is. Don't fight it. And so I actually think we've had plenty of very significant sources of conflict in our marriage. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>17:01\r</p><p>Rollin Mayes\r</p><p>One of the kind of crazy things about this aspect of our story is I don't know if we really ever have had really deep conflict related to this, because part of what ends up happening in this story is there's kind of what Rachel described happened in her. It was very miraculous. I don't know how else to describe it. It was a sense of there are moments in her life where she's just been fundamentally changed. And the moment that she described happening in 2016 where she kind of yielded, kind of surrendered and was like, God, I can give this up. And then she felt this sense of God saying, no, I want you to keep asking. And then also to be vulnerable and to really engage our community in terms of praying for us, is that she really it's one of the real fundamental changes in who she was as a person. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>17:50\r</p><p>Rollin Mayes\r</p><p>And one of the things that happened out of that is that she completely gave up any attempt to try to control it in any way. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>17:56\r</p><p>Mark Mellinger\r</p><p>How does that happen? \r</p><p>\r</p><p>17:59\r</p><p>Rollin Mayes\r</p><p>I don't try to because I know Rachel really well. It's one of those things that when I try to explain it to people, all I can say is it's basically a miracle. So what ended up happening in our journey is that I had been in this kind of passive, resigned place, really just tagging along with Rachel because she was just desperate to try to get answer or solution. And then she went through this very deep transformation the summer of 2016, and out of that, she just gave up all of her control. And really what she even shared with me was like, ron, I'm just good to do whatever you feel comfortable with. And she meant it. There was never, I can tell you, from 2016 through 2023, I never felt pressure from her ever. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>18:46\r</p><p>Mark Mellinger\r</p><p>That's wonderful. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>18:47\r</p><p>Rollin Mayes\r</p><p>She was like, repressing. You know what I mean? You can kind of fake, like, oh, just do what you like. We're okay. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>18:53\r</p><p>Mark Mellinger\r</p><p>Oh, yeah. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>18:54\r</p><p>Rollin Mayes\r</p><p>For a while, even convince yourself in your own mind for a while. It was not fake. It was a very real, deep, lasting freedom, and there is no explanation for it outside of the Holy Spirit transforming, doing something transformative in her heart. And then I would say through the space that created where she really was yielded to God and then even just really yielded in the context of, like, Ron, I'm just okay with whatever you feel comfortable with is that it created this space where God could do a work that was going to be transforming me. So it's kind of like I was behind her in that she had to go through her work in order to create the space that God could do something really deep in me and really the invitation that I ultimately felt. And it just took me years to get there because it was so easy for me to stay in the place of Passivity and not knowing. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>19:50\r</p><p>Rollin Mayes\r</p><p>I didn't even want to know why we might be struggling with infertility, because the possibility, like, the range of answers to why we might struggle with infertility was just like, I don't even want to know. I just want to remain in the dark. Ignorance is bliss. I mean, not really bliss, but it's better than the alternative. I think what was happening is that as God really god was growing me as a man in the context of our marriage and this journey and the freedom that she had gave me, the space to really come to terms with, like, man, I have this desire for children. And I think instead of being in this resigned place, I want to engage with that. And I want to take the risks with Rachel related to even figuring out why we might be struggling with. So I could go into more detail about what that ended up looking like for me. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>20:46\r</p><p>Rollin Mayes\r</p><p>But I think that's kind of the overall arc of my story. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>20:50\r</p><p>Mark Mellinger\r</p><p>Yeah. And this is just fascinating. I love hearing it because what God did was really he brought you to each individually in different ways, to places that you were uncomfortable going, places of the heart where you were uncomfortable going at one point. And that's just a wonderful work of grace, and it doesn't happen. You hear people say, people change, but not much. And that's usually true. But this is really hopeful because it shows that in the spirit, people can change. And I'm so glad that you two did I mean, you did end up deciding to pursue, okay, what's causing this? What do we want to do? How did you get to the point where you decided, okay, this is how we're going to plunge ahead? And eventually, of course, you found this little clinic in Tennessee that you ended up going to a whole heck of a lot. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>21:56\r</p><p>Rollin Mayes\r</p><p>You sure? Probably, yeah. So I think I went through these stages of even realizing, like, I needed to I said, engage. Part of what that even meant for me was I need to intentionally bring this issue in our lives to mind as opposed to just kind of setting it aside or forgetting it in the context of other sort of higher urgency stressors. I need to bring this to mind and in my relationship with God, engage Him about it and do this in my relationship with other people. So I kind of had this sort of set of goals I went through of like, okay, I'm just going to get more intentional about this. I'm going to measure success for myself in the sense of, am I thinking about it more often? Am I praying about a little more often? Am I talking about a little more often? \r</p><p>\r</p><p>22:48\r</p><p>Rollin Mayes\r</p><p>And as I went through that process, I remember a moment where I shared with some other leaders in our church, and one of the men approached me afterwards, and he was specifically talking about some of the fears that I had related to even getting a diagnosis of our infertility. He told me it's better to essentially know something that's painful in the light than sort of hide from the truth in the darkness. So you might find out something that's really painful, but it's better to know that as opposed to try to seek refuge in ignorance. And so that really started to kind of, like, simmer and work on me. And I just came to a point where I thought, no, I'm ready to move forward with this was back was it 21 2021. I remember telling Rachel, we usually do, like, every semester, we'll do like, a little weekend getaway. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>23:49\r</p><p>Rollin Mayes\r</p><p>And I'd kind of start up in my brain on this weekend getaway, I'm going to bring up to Rachel, I think I'm ready to go for this. And I brought it up with her. And then we just went through a series of steps over about six months, starting with kind of a primary care doctor and trying to get a diagnosis, find out why are we not having babies? And what's sort of fascinating about that is that process ended with us having undiagnosed infertility. So we still have no idea. And in a strange way, that was actually kind of a relief. I was deeply worried that I was fraud. That's what's going to happen. We're going to do these tests. We're going to find out I'm not producing sperm, or whatever it may be. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>24:38\r</p><p>Mark Mellinger\r</p><p>That was probably your biggest fear all along. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>24:41\r</p><p>Rollin Mayes\r</p><p>Yeah. And so in some weird way, that was kind of a relief. People take that kind of information differently. For us, it was almost a weird relief. And then from there, we're talking with the doctors that were with at that point, I think it was just your OBGYN. So then we did four IUIs locally, like, in Texas and went through the process that anybody who's done any fertility treatment knows, which is that you do it and then for two weeks, it's like your life hangs in the balance. There are two futures that stand in front of you, and you have literally no idea which way your life is going to go. You're imagining either and then you go through this process of in a moment, you find out. And one of those futures is so for know in that context, those four IUIs, it was four stages of those two week periods and then finding out. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>25:39\r</p><p>Rollin Mayes\r</p><p>And then part of what our story in this, like rachel really let out in this sense of we are going to involve our community. We are going to go the complete opposite direction of shame and of hiding. And so part of what was really painful about that because that may sound really nice in theory, but part of what was really painful and we don't have any regrets, but part of what was painful about it was that every time we would get bad news, we did an IUI and we're not pregnant. We would have all these people that were waiting with us, and then we had to be the bearers of bad news to them. And it felt like almost like sometimes I think even with the way that we engage community, we could almost feel guilt. Like we're putting you guys I mean, people were choosing to invest in us. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>26:27\r</p><p>Rollin Mayes\r</p><p>It wasn't like were propelling them in some kind of way. They cared about us. But it's almost like we are going through this roller coaster. But now, because you care about us and because we've invited you into our story, you're going through a roller coaster, and you're having to deal with all this pain and disappointment and even questions related to god and why is this happening? And so that would add to the sense of pain even when we would get the bad news about the. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>26:57\r</p><p>Mark Mellinger\r</p><p>And. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>26:57\r</p><p>Rollin Mayes\r</p><p>So that gets us most of the way to how we ended up at southeastern. I don't know if you want us to keep going. I think rachel could maybe share about how we ended. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>27:03\r</p><p>Mark Mellinger\r</p><p>Yeah, yeah, go ahead. Rachel interested in hearing that. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>27:06\r</p><p>Rachel Mayes\r</p><p>So what's funny is, I think from the start of even when we started struggling with infertility, I always had this fear in the back of my mind, like, what if it comes down to someone tells us, like, IVF is your next option? And for some reason, IVF just felt pretty daunting and scary. So it's like even when we started pursuing IUIs, I remember my OB. I think after the second IUI, she said, hey, just be thinking about IVF. So what we did is we did our third IUI. It was summer of 2022, and then went on a big road trip. So we had kind of space a couple of months to really just process like, do we want to go for a fourth IUI? Should we think about seeing a fertility specialist? And so we kind of decided, let's just move forward with both. So we kind of moved forward with doing the fourth IUI, which resulted not working. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>28:08\r</p><p>Rachel Mayes\r</p><p>And we had scheduled an appointment with a fertility specialist in the area. And I still remember thinking when we go, what's going to happen? And I remember when we had that appointment, it felt like a huge victory for both of us because it wasn't. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>28:28\r</p><p>Rollin Mayes\r</p><p>Just to have the appointment. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>28:29\r</p><p>Rachel Mayes\r</p><p>Yeah, just even having the appointment, like seeing an actual fertility specialist, because previously we had just been working with an OB. And I remember in the appointment, she basically told us, my worst fear or one of my fears. She said, well, I think based on looking at your history, like IVF would be the next step. And I remember it was about a year ago at this time, because I think it was like September 30 we had the appointment. And I remember coming home and that night and waking up the next day realizing that fear I felt towards IVF, I didn't feel it. I didn't feel like, afraid. And if anything, I actually felt this sense of peace and excitement about doing it, which just, I think really surprised me because I think there's ways in which I think I probably kind of had a critical view of IVF. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>29:32\r</p><p>Rachel Mayes\r</p><p>I think what I believe and God totally humbled me in that I think I believe like, oh, that's just too much control. Kind of like I just a little judgmental. And you realize when you're in it, you're like, no, you don't have control. You can do certain things, but really, when it comes down to it, you don't have control. But, yeah, I felt like God really humbled me in it, and I don't know how to describe it other than it just felt like there was an open door. It felt like God had opened this door to kind of explore IVF. So then as were starting to explore it, I was kind of rethinking kind of our appointment with the fertility specialist and even kind of the process she described and the things they do, and things weren't adding up to me. It was kind of like, wait, that doesn't seem it just felt like it was hitting on just kind of our morals and what we believe about the sanctity of life. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>30:39\r</p><p>Rachel Mayes\r</p><p>And so then there was this dilemma that it was like, okay, well, I feel like we kind of felt this sense like god was opening a door to explore, but how are we going to do this in a way that feels like is right and honoring God and protecting life? And I kind of just felt like this sense god was encouraging us. He was basically saying, like, oh, I trust you guys to walk through this. So then it was like, what do we do? We just felt this sense of we couldn't work with that fertility specialist. I think then it kind of felt a little overwhelming, like, well, how could we do this in a way that feels like is right based on what we believe? And I remember you had, like, a doctor's appointment with his primary care, and. I remember you kind of asked your doctor for if he knew anyone, and he didn't know anyone, but he just said I remember him saying, like, you just need to make sure you're on the same page. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>31:40\r</p><p>Rachel Mayes\r</p><p>Whoever you work with, you just got to make sure you're on the same page. So it just felt like, okay, I don't know what we're going to do. So I just started doing different research. And if you Google Christian IVF, you all are like the first people that pop up. And what's funny is, the first few times I Googled it, I would always skip below. I don't know why. I have no idea why. I just kind of skipped down. I would never look at your website, and I was looking at other things. And then I think I finally looked at your website and y'all had recently posted you had something on there that was kind of an explanation of Roe v. Wade, because this was like, right after Roe v. Wade was overturned, right? And I just reading kind of Y'all's explanation and I was like, wow, this is exactly what I'd want. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>32:35\r</p><p>Rachel Mayes\r</p><p>Like, the things y'all do, this is you know, then I did the research and I was like, oh, you guys are in Tennessee. Okay, so here's the thing with Roland and I is we're big adventures. Part of our journey of nine years of infertility is we really lived up those years. We did so many road trips. We did some pretty wild my family actually lives in Illinois, so we're accustomed to just doing long trips. So for some reason, Tennessee did not feel like too much. It just felt like, oh, is this just another adventure, but a different adventure? And so we did the 15 minutes. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>33:22\r</p><p>Mark Mellinger\r</p><p>Tele 15 minutes call. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>33:24\r</p><p>Rollin Mayes\r</p><p>Yeah. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>33:24\r</p><p>Rachel Mayes\r</p><p>With Dr. Gordon. I remember it was like right before Thanksgiving with Dr. Gordon, and it just felt really encouraging. We're like, wow. It just felt like the door continued to stay open. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>33:38\r</p><p>Rollin Mayes\r</p><p>Well, one of the things I was going to say is that part of the process for me at every stage was I couldn't make a plan for or anticipate where the story might be going. I just had to make a decision to take the step right in front of us. And so that was part of what it was kind of like, that's what I could do. I didn't have the courage to commit to, like, we're going to do IVF, but I could commit to, let's do a free 15 minutes consultation with Dr. Gordon, and then with no strings attached, we do anything after that. We may just do that. Then it's kind of like, take the step right in front of us and then learn from that. Be able to go, okay, what did we just learn in the step that we took? What are our options now? \r</p><p>\r</p><p>34:28\r</p><p>Rollin Mayes\r</p><p>And then take one more step. That's part of as I was kind of walking through my own fear of, like, part of the way I would say it is like, I know pain and difficulty is just part of life, but choosing to do something that could be really painful and difficult, I'll generally pass. I mean, it's like there's enough challenges that are just going to happen, right. To move into this space where it felt like I was risking my heart at such a level, all I could do was take one step at a time and in a sense, say, rach, I can't plan on or commit to anything beyond that, but let's just do. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>35:16\r</p><p>Mark Mellinger\r</p><p>That'S. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>35:17\r</p><p>Rollin Mayes\r</p><p>Really helpful allowed me to keep engaging, but we always felt this sense of, we don't know where this is going. We're not going to make assumptions. We're not going to kind of get locked in on a plan of several steps. We're just going to take the one step in front of us. And that's, like I said, literally the only way I could have done it. I couldn't have done it any other way. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>35:39\r</p><p>Mark Mellinger\r</p><p>That's great. And she went at your pace. So how did you finally get locked in? I mean, eventually you had to lock in on a. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>35:50\r</p><p>Rachel Mayes\r</p><p>We then we did an initial appointment in january. It worked out know, were driving up to illinois for christmas to see my family, and it just worked out timing wise. Oh, on the way back, why don't we just swing by? It's a little out of the way, but it's its own trip, and I don't know. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>36:12\r</p><p>Rollin Mayes\r</p><p>I remember it is the one step at a time, I think, that's even, like, we did the 15 minutes consultation, and it was like, okay, the next step would actually be to visit Southeastern and kind of do a more in depth conversation and a couple of initial tests. And so then it was like, do we want to do that? Yeah, okay, we can do that. And if we do that, we're not committing to the whole thing. It's just like, we're just taking it that one step. And it really worked out beautifully timing wise, that, like I said, were able to kind of partner it with a trip to see family that we're already doing anyways. And so then we did that visit in january, and then we came away from that. We sort of reflected on what it. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>36:54\r</p><p>Rachel Mayes\r</p><p>And I remember feeling really encouraged. I remember when were driving, it was like the next morning, were kind of driving back to texas, just really feeling this sense, like, just a lot of peace, and I just felt a lot of encouragement from the lord, like, oh, that we could do this. We did go through a process right after where we just because it felt like it was a really big decision. So we asked some of our close friends and all of our family members. We just talked to them about it and kind of got their input. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>37:29\r</p><p>Rollin Mayes\r</p><p>I was going to say, I think for us, part of the feeling was there are a lot of just ethical complexities related to IVF. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>37:37\r</p><p>Mark Mellinger\r</p><p>There are no doubt. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>37:39\r</p><p>Rollin Mayes\r</p><p>And I think part of what we felt like was like our priority. We would love to have children, and if God wanted to use IVF to give us children, we wanted to walk down that road. But if it was children through IVF or doing what we felt like was honoring God, which if that meant not doing IVF, like if we arrived at a point where we thought, man, we can't wrap our minds around, feeling really confident before God that this is a good decision that honors him and honors life and honors humanity. It's made in his image that we're not going to do it. And so it was really significant for us and I'm really glad that we did this, that in the process, like Rachel mentioned after that appointment in January, before we actually did our first cycle of IVF, is that we invited our pastors and their wives. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>38:32\r</p><p>Rollin Mayes\r</p><p>We just laid it in front of them and said, what do you guys think about this? Do y'all have any concerns? Do y'all see red flags? And then we, one by one, went through every adult couple in our immediate families who are all followers of Jesus. We went through and just had the same kind of conversation, said, here's what we're thinking about doing, but we don't want to do it if it's wrong, and we trust you guys. Do you all have concerns about this? And that process was really important for us because we wanted, if were going to do it with a very high degree of confidence. Not that anybody can have perfect certainty of, like, I know for sure that what I'm doing is right. But just in the sense of that, we could say, man, went through what we knew how to go through. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>39:13\r</p><p>Rollin Mayes\r</p><p>In terms of seeking counsel, doing research, searching our own hearts, doing it over a period of time, not rushing into something so that whatever decision we end up with at the end of this, it's one that we can. Feel confident in based on the process went through and as kind of an expression a process that was an expression of God, we trust you to lead in this. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>39:37\r</p><p>Mark Mellinger\r</p><p>It's a great takeaway. And again, have a circle of advisors that's really smart. Never rush into this, especially if you have reservations about the complexities of it, like Roland and Rachel have said. So you did obviously end up deciding to move forward with it and talk about what God brought from your journey with us. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>40:02\r</p><p>Rachel Mayes\r</p><p>Yeah, well, we ended up doing two cycles of mini stem IVF. And so the first cycle, went out in March, that first cycle resulted in a really early miscarriage. I think you would call it a miscarriage. I mean, it was like I got. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>40:27\r</p><p>Mark Mellinger\r</p><p>A low positive, but maybe a neck topic. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>40:31\r</p><p>Rachel Mayes\r</p><p>Yeah, it was a very painful well. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>40:37\r</p><p>Rollin Mayes\r</p><p>It was a painful end. The experience in Tennessee and with Southeastern was really special. We also had rachel's parents came and spent part of the time with us just to support us, and that was a very special time. With the actual I think there's no other way to say it the actual day of the embryo transfer was probably one of the more traumatic experiences that we have had as a couple, because went into it thinking, well, even if this transfer is unsuccessful, we'll probably have little embryo babies to come back for. Based on what we had found out about the fertilization numbers. And when we came in that day, we ended up finding out that, really, we only had one embryo that made sense to transfer, and that maybe two, but they thought even that second 1 may have already stopped growing. And so it wasn't like anybody there was anything wrong in that. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>41:46\r</p><p>Rollin Mayes\r</p><p>It was just based on our assumptions or expectations. We expected that we would have kind of this almost we just didn't expect that in a range. For whatever reason, it just was not in our brains that was a possibility. And so to find that out was very devastating. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>42:03\r</p><p>Mark Mellinger\r</p><p>And you found it out the day you were here. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>42:05\r</p><p>Rollin Mayes\r</p><p>Yeah. Because that's just the way it works. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>42:06\r</p><p>Mark Mellinger\r</p><p>That's just how it is. Right. And that happens. Those are very sad times. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>42:11\r</p><p>Rollin Mayes\r</p><p>Yeah. And so it was very painful. And I remember even we almost right away believed, even before we found out that Rachel wasn't pregnant, we thought, this isn't going to work. It's like everything it's like the script flipped on us in this moment, and went from, man, God, this has been such a beautiful experience. We've loved being in Southeastern. We've loved being in Tennessee in late March, early April. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>42:37\r</p><p>Mark Mellinger\r</p><p>Absolutely. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>42:37\r</p><p>Rollin Mayes\r</p><p>Yeah. Nice time of, like, everything just felt like had been a great experience to wait. This is devastating. This isn't going to work. And I remember even Rachel brought up that same day, like, well, if it doesn't, like, maybe we can come back. And I literally had to say I wasn't mad, but I just had to say, I can't even talk about that. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>43:00\r</p><p>Mark Mellinger\r</p><p>Yeah. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>43:00\r</p><p>Rollin Mayes\r</p><p>I can't even think about doing that. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>43:03\r</p><p>Mark Mellinger\r</p><p>One step at a time. Right. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>43:05\r</p><p>Rollin Mayes\r</p><p>Yes. And I think, even for me, over the next few days, even before we found out that she wasn't pregnant, like I said, were both operating in the conviction, almost, that she wasn't. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>43:18\r</p><p>Rachel Mayes\r</p><p>Well, I think part of it is when you struggle with infertility for so long, it's almost hard to believe. Yeah, I think it was partly that, too. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>43:27\r</p><p>Rollin Mayes\r</p><p>And I was going through a process internally of like, man, God, I feel like you brought me to this point of leaning into something that was very scary and difficult for me. And I kind of sensed even in the first few days after that first cycle ended, I felt like he was kind of indicating that he was going to invite us to come back for a second time. And that was very upsetting to me. I actually felt angry at God. It felt like the analogy I've used is I've told people it was like I just climbed one of the biggest mountains of my life just to get here was a huge mountain. I summited it, and then God beamed me down to the bottom and said, Climb it again. And I felt like, how could you do this? It's like, you're asking too much. You're asking too much of us. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>44:16\r</p><p>Rollin Mayes\r</p><p>You're asking too much of me. And I think through that process, I actually got to a moment the way I would phrase it is almost the sense was as if God was asking me, do you believe that I only write good stories? And the implication was, if you do believe that, then you'll follow me wherever I lead. Even if it doesn't make sense, and even if it feels terrifying, you will follow me because you'll believe I'm only going to write a good story. And I didn't mean good story in the sense of one that would end with a pregnancy. I meant good in the sense of whatever in the context of God's providence is, the way that he wants to move in this world through us, through our lives, in us. And really what it was a very deep moment of being invited to surrender to Him, of like to say, yes, God, I believe you only write good stories. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>45:12\r</p><p>Rollin Mayes\r</p><p>Which if that's true, then if you're asking us to go back for a second time, I'll do it. And part of what I can even say in that is that we had by that point, a very large community, probably in the hundreds. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>45:29\r</p><p>Rachel Mayes\r</p><p>Yeah. We would have friends that would say, oh, yeah, my mom's Bible study is pretty yeah. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>45:34\r</p><p>Rollin Mayes\r</p><p>Because were updating like a blog and we had asked people to help us financially going into the first one. And so we had this huge community of people that was with us and had been praying for us. And I felt like that moment of surrender to God, of saying, I believe you only write good stories, so I'll follow you. It was like something and I'm using this word very intentionally, it was like he was birthing something in me, like a level of submission that felt almost deeper than there's just a very few moments in my life that I could say I felt like that level of like, okay, God, I submit to you. And it felt like a very direct product of people praying for us. And it was as if they had been praying that we would have kids. They would have been praying that god would bless the IVF process. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>46:28\r</p><p>Rollin Mayes\r</p><p>But part of the way that god was answering that was by, in a sense, you'd say, conceiving and birthing something in us, and in that moment in me that was changing me. And it's part of, like I think once I got to that point, I was able to actually get really excited about going into a second IVF cycle, because what I felt like was I was like, god, I know. Regardless of whether this ends in children, you are doing something deeply significant in our lives and deeply good in our lives. And I'm experiencing that, like I said, in the context of this community of people, that it felt like he had raised up that were praying for us. And so that's what ended up kind of on my end, turning me toward the corner. I think Rachel was always open to going a second time, but helped me turn the corner towards, we can do this. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>47:23\r</p><p>Rachel Mayes\r</p><p>Yeah. Yeah. I had felt like even when were in the first, like, thinking, okay, this isn't too like, I had always been scared of the needles, all of that, and just realizing, this isn't too bad. So I remember the day after the transfer when we knew the first cycle, when we knew most likely what am I trying to say? When we knew most likely that the rest of our embryos had arrested. I remember just feeling this sense of like, I would do it again. So I felt like an openness but just kind of like an open handedness kind of because I just knew again, if we're going to do it together on the same page. And part of it is I remember just asking the lord, because I know the biggest hurdle probably for us coming back would have been, like, the finances of how is this going to work? \r</p><p>\r</p><p>48:26\r</p><p>Rachel Mayes\r</p><p>And I just remember that morning, the morning after the transfer, I think just asking God, I'm like, man, I'm open to doing this, but we're just going to need you to provide somehow. And it was crazy because later that day, we basically is like, God answered that prayer, and there was this supernatural just provision financially that if we wanted to go for it again, it was kind of like there was almost like an open door. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>48:56\r</p><p>Rollin Mayes\r</p><p>Awesome. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>48:57\r</p><p>Mark Mellinger\r</p><p>And so then you were able to come back for the second try. Did it feel better the second day or the second time? \r</p><p>\r</p><p>49:05\r</p><p>Rachel Mayes\r</p><p>Yeah, well, I think partly the second cycle because we knew what to expect. It was way more relaxing. But, I mean, both times I will just say I absolutely love the staff at southeastern fertility. Even I was thinking about I had to adjust to when I was basically graduated from southeastern fertility. I've been so spoiled that I can send my nurse an email, and she'll just email me within a few hours. So there's just this level of it's just very personal. I don't know how to describe it. And there's just a level of care. And I just really appreciate just how just even with Dr. Gordon just being like a follower of Jesus, and it's like, well, what other clinic can you go to? And they'll pray with you? So it was like a dream come true. The second cycle almost felt like just really fun. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>50:06\r</p><p>Rachel Mayes\r</p><p>I don't know how I know that sounds really strange, but just felt like. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>50:10\r</p><p>Rollin Mayes\r</p><p>Well, we had a sense, too. We felt going in the second cycle, this is the end of this part of the journey. I had actually gotten to a point where I actually felt very strongly we would get pregnant. I was like, I could be wrong, but I had a very deep sense of, I think we're going to get pregnant. I also felt like even if we don't, I think this will be the end of our journey. With fertility treatment, it felt like a fullness of time moment, like just one of those things where it was interesting in our own individual ways. Rachel and I both kind of got to that point where we just really realized whether there are children or not at the end of this second cycle. This second cycle just feels like this is the end of a chapter. I think that gave a lot of peace going into it, too. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>51:02\r</p><p>Rollin Mayes\r</p><p>It just felt like, okay, yeah, like I said, for me, definitely felt like god got me here, he got us here. He provided for us in ways that we couldn't have imagined to even make it possible. And I think he's going to give us a kid at the end of this. But even if he doesn't, there's just this sense of very deep gratitude for the whole story and just seeing his hand in our lives for good, period. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>51:33\r</p><p>Mark Mellinger\r</p><p>Well, the changes that he's cultivated in your own souls, the level of community that he's given you, there are so many good marks of God all over your story, right? I mean, regardless of the result, and so many of us, such a key point that God only writes good stories. I mean, we believe that. And yet I would say most of us spend our lives negotiating for a different story. We don't like the one we're in. We don't want to play the role that he's uniquely given us to play. And that's just a constant battle. But I love how you guys have given us a window into how he shaped your thinking to say, I'm going to run the race he has for me, I'm not going to run the race he has for somebody else that I wish were my race. That's just a place you have to get to in the Christian life if you're going to grow in your relationship with God. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>52:34\r</p><p>Mark Mellinger\r</p><p>So what are you feeling now? You did get pregnant from your second transfer. You're what, about three months or so along now? \r</p><p>\r</p><p>52:44\r</p><p>Rachel Mayes\r</p><p>Yes. What was it like? Yeah, I just entered the second trimester last week. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>52:50\r</p><p>Mark Mellinger\r</p><p>Okay. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>52:51\r</p><p>Rachel Mayes\r</p><p>It's funny, I did not anticipate how much I would struggle with fear of miscarriage. So it was a little rough initially. It's like we took the first HCG, it was positive, the second one doubled. And I think partly the reason why I struggle with fear is because I can still try and assert control and there's ways in which I'm, like, just I don't know how to describe it. I just really struggled feeling convinced like I'd miscarried for no really logical reason. But yeah, the first few weeks were kind of challenging. It's like I just thought, like, oh, once we get pregnant, then it'd be great. I don't know if that's just a result of you walk through nine years. It's almost like I had gotten used to just disappointment and bad news and learned to receive it and trust the Lord in it was almost like I didn't know how to receive this gift. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>53:58\r</p><p>Rachel Mayes\r</p><p>And so it's been kind of a journey of just like, walking and just again open handedness because there always is the possibility that could happen. But I remember one of the sweetest things was because we had involved community, people knew. So probably a lot of people don't do this, but people knew the day we found out were pregnant. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>54:25\r</p><p>Rollin Mayes\r</p><p>They knew were finding out because. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>54:27\r</p><p>Rachel Mayes\r</p><p>They knew were finding out, so everybody knew. And so I remember the following week, I was actually at a ministry planning retreat with all of our student leaders in our college ministry. And I just remember I'm thinking in particular one girl that was out there, and she just kept telling me, she's like, Rachel, you're a walking miracle. Or when we would have one of our evening meetings and were taking communion, she was like, this is your baby's first communion. And it just really ministered to me when I was actually struggling with this belief. Like, when we have this first ultrasound, like this fear of like, are we going to see a little baby in a little heartbeat? It was like God was just taking care of me as I was really struggling through community of people who were excited and praying. I think once we hit nine weeks, I was like, wait, okay, I think this is really happening. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>55:26\r</p><p>Rachel Mayes\r</p><p>But it's taken a while and I don't think the significance of this moment has really sunk in. I think it'll take some time just to really fathom it. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>55:38\r</p><p>Mark Mellinger\r</p><p>That's beautiful. Roland, how about you? \r</p><p>\r</p><p>55:41\r</p><p>Rollin Mayes\r</p><p>Yeah, no, I experienced similar things. I mean, I've told people, I know this isn't objectively true, but because of our experience intuitively, I just think pregnancy doesn't work, it doesn't work. And so the prediction emotionally is it won't work. Even if something initially works, it will eventually not work. Probably everybody's like this, but I want to anticipate the possible disappointments in part, so I can protect myself against the pain because the shock of pain feels worse than predicted pain, right? Yeah, I felt that, too. But again, if I was to kind of try to capture my sense of even when went to our initial ultrasounds, because it's like we had one at six and a half weeks, eight weeks, nine weeks, so we had a bunch in a row. It's like we're doing this almost every week was I felt like this sense of almost like God would be saying, just receive the gift. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>56:50\r</p><p>Rollin Mayes\r</p><p>Can you go into this with an excitement like, oh, I get to see our baby, as opposed to a fear, like, what if I don't? And it wasn't like a psychological trick. It wasn't like, well, just think positively. It was a real sense of, no, just trust what I'm doing in this and just receive it. I don't know how good of a job I did at that. I mean, I think it definitely helped me, but I definitely still struggled with the fear, too. I would notice after we got out of appointments, I was like, whoa, I just got hit with this huge wave of relief, which made me think I was probably in denial about how scared I was going into it. But, yeah, I do think that I felt helped by the Lord in that of just that language of like, just receive it, and kind of this sense of, I'm going to insofar as I'm able in my weakness, go into this appointment and enjoy seeing our baby instead of just feeling this fear of loss. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>57:52\r</p><p>Rollin Mayes\r</p><p>And I think we still work through, like, of course, you Rachel. Like, were playing pickleball last night, and Rachel ran after something really hard, and then she paused and she went, is the baby okay? It's like just this immediate fear of like, what if I did something that just is going to cost us in some deep way. So I think we're still working through that. But I've had a sense and again, I can say it even on this podcast and think, man, I may look like a fool for saying this, but I've had a sense of like, oh, no, I think I'm going to hold this baby in my arms. And not just because we've hit a certain mark or something like that. Not because we've passed a certain threshold or the likelihoods of miscarriage are lower, because I still think, no, we know plenty of people that have miscarried at the point that we're at or later. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>58:45\r</p><p>Rollin Mayes\r</p><p>And so there are no guarantees, but just a sense of like, I think that's what's going to so anyways, there's just been grace in that. I feel like, what Rachel's talking about with our friends? And then I just think that kind of internal work of God in our lives, of like, oh, he's just helping us in our yeah, but I remember maybe this is what I can end with in response to this question, is that I remember after the first ultrasound, somebody saying, have you thought about names yet? And I thought when they said that thought has not even crossed my mind. When were a young couple, before went through infertility, we would fairly frequently, not like all the time, but it's like we would have these like, what if we have kids? What are we going to name them? \r</p><p>\r</p><p>59:43\r</p><p>Mark Mellinger\r</p><p>Right? \r</p><p>\r</p><p>59:43\r</p><p>Rollin Mayes\r</p><p>And in the context of infertility, I think I can say with confidence we probably had gone many years without having one conversation about what we would name a kid because it felt like something that we couldn't even what? Had been a source of joy or kind of a fun connection. Early in our marriage, dreaming about our kids to talk about their names in the context of infertility just felt like pain. And so it literally had not even crossed my mind. Even after we had gotten a positive pregnancy test, we had gone a couple of weeks, and I had not had a single thought, and it was somebody else who was like, have you thought about names? And I think it was definitely a moment of realizing it's kind of where you integrate your own story a little more and you kind of realize, like, oh, wow, just what we had been through. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>01:00:28\r</p><p>Rollin Mayes\r</p><p>And even for me, realizing wait, that actually is a scary question, because if I start thinking about names, it's like I enter into that dream space again, and that dream could be collapsed. I think it's been like we genuinely are unbelievably excited and yet also working through kind of this strange, complex network of emotions. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>01:00:53\r</p><p>Mark Mellinger\r</p><p>Yeah, sure, to some degree, it's going to be that way. A little bit touch and go for the next six months. But things are looking good now, and we're going to hope and believe for you guys as well. Our time is gone. But I just want to thank you two so much for sharing so much. It's really a sacred thing to get a window into your story like this. And I don't know that I've done one of these where there were more helpful takeaways. I think this is really going to help a lot of believers who are going through the same sorts of trials that god has had for you. So just want to thank you two so much, and please know we're going to be praying for you back here in knoxville and cannot wait to see a picture of that baby. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>01:01:41\r</p><p>Rollin Mayes\r</p><p>Thank you. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>01:01:42\r</p><p>Rachel Mayes\r</p><p>Thank you. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>01:01:42\r</p><p>Rollin Mayes\r</p><p>We appreciate y'all well, if this has. \r</p><p>\r</p><p>01:01:45\r</p><p>Mark Mellinger\r</p><p>Been helpful to you, don't forget to rate review and subscribe to the podcast that'll help get the word out.

All right. Well, Linda, it's a beautiful Friday here in East Tennessee. Gorgeous, absolutely. Dr. Gordon and Linda come at you Facebook Friday. Southeastern fertility friday. That's right. And it's field trip edition. We're going on a field trip. Here we are, Linda, by our back door of 11126 Kingston Pike.</p><p><strong><br>00:19</strong><br>Lynda McCollum<br>Yes.</p><p><strong><br>00:20</strong><br>Dr. John Gordon<br>The home of southeastern Fertility. Now we're going to take a little journey, a journey into the future, a journey into the imagination.</p><p><strong><br>00:27</strong><br>Lynda McCollum<br>Linda, you need your hair to do that.</p><p><strong><br>00:31</strong><br>Dr. John Gordon<br>All right. Walk with us, Mark, as we walk to the future, everyone still says, oh, I love Linda on Facebook Friday. These pages come in for all the country. I love Linda. Dr. Gordon there, too. All right. They get run down. All right. You see walking here towards our field, all right. So here we are. We are what they say about people who are good in their profession? They say that we are outstanding in our field. So here we are, Linda. We're outstanding in our field. That's right. Because this is the field that I bought.</p><p><strong><br>01:16</strong><br>Lynda McCollum<br>The field of the future.</p><p><strong><br>01:17</strong><br>Dr. John Gordon<br>Field of dreams. That's right. Isn't it so nice? It's a shame all those trees have been cut down, but that's okay. Actually, the town of Farrogate Plant Commission was very adamant about getting rid of the Bartlett pears because those trees are like just sucker plants. They're just awful. They're just like terrible plants. That's right. This is a lot. That is now the future home of Southeastern Fertility and the NDC in the NDC. We have our plans for our building, a pass through the town planning commission, and here we are.</p><p><strong><br>01:57</strong><br>Lynda McCollum<br>When is our breaking ground ceremony going to be? Do we know yet?</p><p><strong><br>02:01</strong><br>Dr. John Gordon<br>10:00 a.m. Tomorrow.</p><p><strong><br>02:02</strong><br>Lynda McCollum<br>Seriously?</p><p><strong><br>02:03</strong><br>Dr. John Gordon<br>No. Always takes longer than you think, right? I mean, for patients, too, right? Patients, they don't want to wait, right. It's all about waiting, trying to be patient. Right. We've had some patients that tried their patients this month in terms of just cycles not quite lining up. And that is hard, isn't it?</p><p><strong><br>02:25</strong><br>Lynda McCollum<br>It's very hard.</p><p><strong><br>02:26</strong><br>Dr. John Gordon<br>It is hard. And I think that's the thing.</p><p><strong><br>02:28</strong><br>Lynda McCollum<br>I get it. I want all my results, like, yesterday.</p><p><strong><br>02:31</strong><br>Dr. John Gordon<br>That's right. We want our groundbreaking to be yesterday, but we're not there yet. We're getting we're pushing as fast as we can. As fast as we can. I know. It's all as great. They say that you catch more bees with honey than vinegar. That's right. Anyway, so of course, that's the other thing, too, is that we're trying to play nice or salt and sugar. Right? Catch more flies with sugar than salt. Right. So we're trying to be nice. Right. My wife said, don't you all go all Yankee on those people, because you're going to get nowhere with it. She is happy to be back in the south. But patience is a virtue, right, Linda? It is a virtue as our patients having to be patient. It is. Especially when we're doing natural cycles. We're trying to do these natural cycle, frozen natural cycle, IVF. Sometimes they just and you do your best.</p><p><strong><br>03:36</strong><br>Dr. John Gordon<br>You want a short cycle, get a long cycle. You want a long cycle, you get a short cycle. And we can manipulate, right? I mean, there are things we can do. We do our best again. So I'm thinking we have new building. We'll just work every weekend. I'll put, like, a little cottage out back for you, and you can just stay there. I can just say, linda, wake up. Time to do the retrieval. Every weekend. Every weekend.</p><p><strong><br>04:02</strong><br>Lynda McCollum<br>He's messed up. Too much stress.</p><p><strong><br>04:06</strong><br>Dr. John Gordon<br>Every weekend. You ever see the movie Breaking Away, right? You break away the story about a little Indianapolis road race with the bicycles, little 500 counties and the town gown type of thing, between the preppies and the townies and all that. The lead character's dad owns a used car lot, and his son said, well, I'll just give you a refund then. And the dad's like, refund. He kept waking up from these nightmares going, refund. It's like weekend. Every weekend. Every weekend. Every weekend. You can work every weekend out. I think you let me know.</p><p><strong><br>04:44</strong><br>Lynda McCollum<br>Like a family size tent about right there on that halfway until we get ready.</p><p><strong><br>04:49</strong><br>Dr. John Gordon<br>We could do that. I think that'd be great. We just ask you to be patient, as we're being patient here, for those patients where the cycles aren't quite lining up the way we hope. Be patient, right? Patience is a virtue, isn't it?</p><p><strong><br>05:04</strong><br>Lynda McCollum<br>It is.</p><p><strong><br>05:05</strong><br>Dr. John Gordon<br>It is a virtue, right? That's right. We are called to allison, we're called to wait on the Lord. It always does pay off, because our time frame may not be his time frame. We're just trying to be faithful. But it's hard sometimes, right?</p><p><strong><br>05:24</strong><br>Lynda McCollum<br>It is hard.</p><p><strong><br>05:25</strong><br>Dr. John Gordon<br>There's always that desire to pick up the pen and write your own stories. Moving along. Moving along, right. That doesn't always work. No, not in the Bible. There's certainly evidence where that has not resulted in good outcome.</p><p><strong><br>05:40</strong><br>Lynda McCollum<br>No.</p><p><strong><br>05:41</strong><br>Dr. John Gordon<br>So we're all going to be patient. We want to patient. Be a patient. I'm going to get rid of all these allergies. It's going to be a green building, but not this green. So we have allergies. There you go. That's good. Yeah. Thank you. For all of you who are not working this weekend, I hope you enjoy this beautiful East Tennessee day.</p><p><strong><br>06:04</strong><br>Lynda McCollum<br>Thank you.</p><p><strong><br>06:05</strong><br>Dr. John Gordon<br>Yeah. Wait a second.</p><p><strong><br>06:07</strong><br>Lynda McCollum<br>Weekend.</p><p><strong><br>06:08</strong><br>Dr. John Gordon<br>Sorry, the weekend. Refund. Refund. We're working weekend. Anyway, so that's a glimpse of the future as we've traveled into the future with you, our listening audience, and watch actually, the folks who came in recently, this week to talk to us about some joint venture, they were like, we love watching Linda on Facebook Friday. I'm like, I was there.</p><p><strong><br>06:33</strong><br>Lynda McCollum<br>They were very sweet.</p><p><strong><br>06:35</strong><br>Dr. John Gordon<br>They were. They were very nice.</p><p><strong><br>06:36</strong><br>Lynda McCollum<br>And thank you guys for bringing this.</p><p><strong><br>06:38</strong><br>Dr. John Gordon<br>Food was excellent. Excellent.</p><p><strong><br>06:40</strong><br>Lynda McCollum<br>All those extra bowls.</p><p><strong><br>06:41</strong><br>Dr. John Gordon<br>I know. That was amazing, right? I know. Well, speaking of food, I have to go over to UT because I'm meeting with the residents who are putting them through their paces as they do their mock oral exams for their board.</p><p><strong><br>06:54</strong><br>Lynda McCollum<br>Something on the way.</p><p><strong><br>06:56</strong><br>Dr. John Gordon<br>You have to be totally stone faced. No feedback, nothing at all. That would be hard. I could be writing down, like, a shopping list, like, pick up dog food and you're like, what's he writing? Exactly. Call plumber. You wasted another twelve minutes of your life with Dr. Gordon and Linda. We're happy you were here. Please come back and we'll see you next Friday, right? Yeah, that's Friday. We're working. Happy weekend.</p>",

Hello, everybody. It's Facebook Friday with Linda Bark behind the camera.</p><p><strong><br>00:08</strong><br>Mark Mellinger<br>Hello, everybody.</p><p><strong><br>00:09</strong><br>Lynda McCollum<br>And today we have miss Brittany. Brittany is our newest addition to the office staff, and we are very happy to have her. So she is going to be Dr. Gordon's IVF nurse for our patients that are going through IVF us here in Knoxville. Most of you guys know Lauren, who was filling in for Megan for her maternity leave. Megan, I missed you, girl, but you didn't come back. So, anyway, Brandy is now going to be our permanent IVF nurse, and she's been with us a whole week, and she keeps coming back.</p><p><strong><br>00:50</strong><br>Mark Mellinger<br>You better not get pregnant and leave. That's all I'm saying. Linda's not going to be happy about that if that happens.</p><p><strong><br>00:59</strong><br>Lynda McCollum<br>Tell me about where you're from. A little bit. Just about general background.</p><p><strong><br>01:04</strong><br>Brittany Hegseth<br>I grew up in a little town, long Beach, Mississippi, much smaller than long Beach, California. I moved to Memphis my senior year of high school, so came into Tennessee and then went to UT after that, and I've been in Knoxville ever since. Love it.</p><p><strong><br>01:21</strong><br>Lynda McCollum<br>Did you go to UT in Memphis or you come here to actually go?</p><p><strong><br>01:25</strong><br>Brittany Hegseth<br>Yeah, here in Knoxville.</p><p><strong><br>01:26</strong><br>Lynda McCollum<br>Cool. So you loved it. Love it. Yeah. It's a neat place to be in. Yeah.</p><p><strong><br>01:31</strong><br>Brittany Hegseth<br>I feel like you're in the mountains. You also have access to the beach.</p><p><strong><br>01:34</strong><br>Lynda McCollum<br>Screen, the lakes, all kinds of lakes around here. Tell me about when you graduated nursing school and what you've done since then before coming down.</p><p><strong><br>01:46</strong><br>Brittany Hegseth<br>So, I actually went to LMU for nursing school. I did, like, an accelerated program. My first job out of school was on anti partum postpartum floor in the hospital. We basically took care of high risk pregnancies. If their water broke early, we'd keep them until they delivered.</p><p><strong><br>02:03</strong><br>Lynda McCollum<br>Okay.</p><p><strong><br>02:04</strong><br>Brittany Hegseth<br>After that, I went to the NICU for and did that, and now I'm here.</p><p><strong><br>02:09</strong><br>Lynda McCollum<br>What was your favorite or your best liked area of working in the hospital? Was it one or the other of those? And I probably say NICU.</p><p><strong><br>02:23</strong><br>Brittany Hegseth<br>I just love working with the babies, so that part I will definitely miss.</p><p><strong><br>02:28</strong><br>Lynda McCollum<br>Show me with your hands what the tiniest baby that you've taken care of.</p><p><strong><br>02:33</strong><br>Brittany Hegseth<br>I mean, some of them can literally sit in your palm.</p><p><strong><br>02:36</strong><br>Lynda McCollum<br>Oh, wow. That is so amazing. That is amazing that they can keep those babies alive till they catch up. Yeah.</p><p><strong><br>02:43</strong><br>Brittany Hegseth<br>Modern medicine has changed everything about the NICU.</p><p><strong><br>02:47</strong><br>Lynda McCollum<br>Awesome.</p><p><strong><br>02:48</strong><br>Brittany Hegseth<br>Yeah.</p><p><strong><br>02:49</strong><br>Lynda McCollum<br>Well, I happened to be in the NICU area once upon a time, not working, but I had to go up and get something from one of the nurses in the same place that you worked. I remember the walls were painted with all kinds of neat kids stuff, and it was just a beautiful place. They did a really good job. On that, and I think that's neat.</p><p><strong><br>03:11</strong><br>Brittany Hegseth<br>Yeah.</p><p><strong><br>03:13</strong><br>Lynda McCollum<br>So when you worked antipartum, is that.</p><p><strong><br>03:16</strong><br>Brittany Hegseth<br>What they called it?</p><p><strong><br>03:17</strong><br>Lynda McCollum<br>Yeah. Okay, so when you worked there, you said if someone's water broke early, that you kept them there and took care of them and tried to basically keep them from having the baby until it was mature enough to survive. How long did you keep your longest patient that you can remember or one of the patients that was on that floor? How long before? From the time they come in with the water breath till they delivered.</p><p><strong><br>03:43</strong><br>Brittany Hegseth<br>I can't remember exactly. I know we had one that came in at 23 weeks. She was really 26. Come in the next day, and I want to say she held on until maybe 32 weeks. So quite a long time. You get the best relationship with those patients. You see them every two, 3 hours.</p><p><strong><br>04:06</strong><br>Lynda McCollum<br>You get attached to them, and you get to know them. It's like family.</p><p><strong><br>04:09</strong><br>Brittany Hegseth<br>Yeah, it really is.</p><p><strong><br>04:11</strong><br>Lynda McCollum<br>When I worked oncology in the hospital, it was much the same way because those patients sometimes are in for weeks or a month or two months, depending.</p><p><strong><br>04:20</strong><br>Brittany Hegseth<br>It was during the height of COVID too, so they weren't all visitors. So we would really like you were.</p><p><strong><br>04:26</strong><br>Lynda McCollum<br>Their visitors and their family, and that's awesome.</p><p><strong><br>04:29</strong><br>Brittany Hegseth<br>Yeah, it was great.</p><p><strong><br>04:29</strong><br>Lynda McCollum<br>I'm sure they were lucky to have you.</p><p><strong><br>04:31</strong><br>Brittany Hegseth<br>It was so special to be able to be with those patients.</p><p><strong><br>04:35</strong><br>Lynda McCollum<br>Tell me your whole five days here.</p><p><strong><br>04:38</strong><br>Brittany Hegseth<br>Yeah.</p><p><strong><br>04:40</strong><br>Lynda McCollum<br>I know that you did get to go in when he did a transfer, an embryo transfer, and you've been in some of the exam rooms during clinic, and I know that you're learning. Believe me, it took me a long time to realize what in the world I was doing, and I was just following order, so please don't ever get discouraged on that. But what have you liked the best?</p><p><strong><br>05:07</strong><br>Brittany Hegseth<br>Definitely the embryo transfer. Yeah, it was goosebumps. I don't think it'll ever get old for me.</p><p><strong><br>05:18</strong><br>Lynda McCollum<br>You think you might want to stick around for a while? Good.</p><p><strong><br>05:24</strong><br>Mark Mellinger<br>You better stick around for a while. Otherwise you're going to incur the wrath of Linda.</p><p><strong><br>05:29</strong><br>Lynda McCollum<br>We got it on camera. You heard her. She's going to be her permanent.</p><p><strong><br>05:36</strong><br>Mark Mellinger<br>Yeah, that's right. You don't want to try it, just ask she who shall not be named. We don't even say her name around here anymore. We don't even say her name.</p><p><strong><br>05:51</strong><br>Lynda McCollum<br>Don't make people think.</p><p><strong><br>05:52</strong><br>Mark Mellinger<br>I'm mean, you are not mean. That's for darn sure. If anybody around here is mean, it ain't you.</p><p><strong><br>05:58</strong><br>Lynda McCollum<br>Okay.</p><p><strong><br>05:58</strong><br>Mark Mellinger<br>I got to ask you, are you an old Miss Fan or a UT fan.</p><p><strong><br>06:03</strong><br>Lynda McCollum<br>UT, for sure.</p><p><strong><br>06:04</strong><br>Mark Mellinger<br>Okay. Well, then I guess you do fit in pretty well around Knoxville. That's great. Well, welcome. Now, are you going to be helping with the NADC folks at all, or is it just southeastern.</p><p><strong><br>06:19</strong><br>Brittany Hegseth<br>Just Southeastern.</p><p><strong><br>06:20</strong><br>Mark Mellinger<br>Okay, so our NADC folks may see you around, but you won't actually be helping with them. Okay, well, good to know. It's great to have you here.</p><p><strong><br>06:28</strong><br>Lynda McCollum<br>Unless me and Burke are built out, and then it's all you, girl.</p><p><strong><br>06:30</strong><br>Brittany Hegseth<br>All right, hold on.</p><p><strong><br>06:34</strong><br>Lynda McCollum<br>Did this morning I did see the most beautiful rainbow? Everybody came in with pictures on their phones. I have to admit, I barely made it here at eight, but I was on time. Dr. Gordon right, at eight, because I had to stop and pull over next to the lake where they love the boats down in off of Concord. Or is that North Shore?</p><p><strong><br>06:57</strong><br>Mark Mellinger<br>That's North Shore. It's North Shore, but I know where you're talking about.

Of course, the last supper was the Passover meal, celebrating Passover. And so here's interesting thing.

We were going to be outstanding in our field, but we're not because it's raining today in East Tennessee. So here we are, Facebook Friday. Linda coming at you from Southeastern Utility.</p><p><strong><br>00:14</strong><br>Lynda McCollum<br>Realtor.</p><p><strong><br>00:15</strong><br>Dr. John Gordon<br>Realtor. That's right. And it's our Good Friday edition.</p><p><strong><br>00:19</strong><br>Lynda McCollum<br>Linda yes, it is.</p><p><strong><br>00:20</strong><br>Dr. John Gordon<br>It is. That's right. Good Friday is a strange thing to call is the day that you really do the derivation of Good Friday? Yeah. I don't think anyone's really sure about.</p><p><strong><br>00:36</strong><br>Lynda McCollum<br>It.</p><p><strong><br>00:40</strong><br>Dr. John Gordon<br>For them to put down direction, so I don't know. I mean, there are different theories out there. I listen to national podcast by Sinclair Ferguson. He was opining about why he thought it was called Good Somebody. That's actually God's day. Or God instead of Good Friday. God's Friday in terms of what God had done for the world. It's a strange thing, right? I think it was good. Such a sad day. Of course, that's a joy that comes Easter. I was raised Jewish, right? Of course, the last supper was the Passover meal, celebrating Passover. And so here's interesting thing. I went off to college, and I was in the cafeteria at Princeton, and it was like the day after Passover, and when they still had all the matza, like the unleavened bread, right? And I said to my friend.</p><p><strong><br>01:38</strong><br>Lynda McCollum<br>Dan.</p><p><strong><br>01:39</strong><br>Dr. John Gordon<br>I said to my friend Danny and Brahmawitz, I said, Danny, what's the deal with all the Mazda still being out? I said passovers last night. He goes, John, Passover last a week.</p><p><strong><br>01:50</strong><br>Lynda McCollum<br>Get out.</p><p><strong><br>01:51</strong><br>Dr. John Gordon<br>I had no idea the Gordon household had barely lasted through the meal. Not a big fan of Mazda. So you're like, Claire, get the bread. I had no idea. It's just an example. I ultimately became a much better Jew as a Christian I ever was as a Jew. Much more. Alice and I are watching something on ancient mystery TV show, and it was talking about the arc of the Covenant.</p><p><strong><br>02:16</strong><br>Lynda McCollum<br>Okay.</p><p><strong><br>02:17</strong><br>Dr. John Gordon<br>Ray is a lost ark, right? The Ark of the Covenant. No joke. Alice was horrified by this. No joke. I wish that movie, when it came out with 81, I believe, right?</p><p><strong><br>02:28</strong><br>Mark Mellinger<br>That was a long time ago. Yeah, 81 or 82.</p><p><strong><br>02:31</strong><br>Dr. John Gordon<br>We were in Salt Lake City at the National Speech Convention. National Speech Competition. Our team had been eliminated. We also came in like, second or third in the country. Okay. Were all sad that we've been eliminated. We went to go see this new movie been released or no Internet, no ability to watch movie trailers. Right? So the rare is a lost ark. And we're like, what is it? I mean, the only arc I knew was, like, the big boat that Noah has all the animals on it, right? I said what? Ray is the lost ark. We go see the movie, and I think, wow, this is incredible. Right. What an amazing movie, right? Amazingly, it was. I told Alison, I said, I didn't know there was an Arc of the Covenant. I thought it was a sign that they made up for the movie. It's in the Bible, you idiot.</p><p><strong><br>03:17</strong><br>Dr. John Gordon<br>I said, I had no idea. What did you learn in Hebrew school? Apparently, I did not learn about the ark of the governance. I was like, I had no idea. There's a bus. Did you know it was no.</p><p><strong><br>03:34</strong><br>Lynda McCollum<br>There we go.</p><p><strong><br>03:35</strong><br>Dr. John Gordon<br>See, that's why we get along. Right? But isn't that amazing?</p><p><strong><br>03:40</strong><br>Lynda McCollum<br>Right?</p><p><strong><br>03:41</strong><br>Dr. John Gordon<br>It's obviously a huge Old Testament thing, right? The box of the Ten Commandments was carrying it and carried in front of the Israelites, and they were victorious in battle, and the ark went before them. Right.</p><p><strong><br>03:54</strong><br>Lynda McCollum<br>And it's there.</p><p><strong><br>03:56</strong><br>Dr. John Gordon<br>They couldn't live it's all there. I thought it was just made up for the movie. Pathetic, right? Pathetic. The level of biblical knowledge in this country is.</p><p><strong><br>04:12</strong><br>Lynda McCollum<br>A teenager.</p><p><strong><br>04:13</strong><br>Dr. John Gordon<br>Yeah, it's always I but I'm just saying, you would have thought that I would know. I hate bio, sometimes we are surprised by the things we don't know, right?</p><p><strong><br>04:22</strong><br>Lynda McCollum<br>Well, I'll tell you, I learned more about the Bible when I started teaching Sunday school for the two and three year old. I didn't have Sunday school church. I went to Baptist church. We did footwashing, but we didn't do Sunday school.</p><p><strong><br>04:40</strong><br>Dr. John Gordon<br>Wow, okay. You were charged with the Sunday school wow.</p><p><strong><br>04:52</strong><br>Speaker 4<br>Right.</p><p><strong><br>04:57</strong><br>Dr. John Gordon<br>Here for transfer today. She was giving everybody she did not like that. She was kind of wondering what was going on, and she was letting everybody know that you don't even know what you don't know. Right? This week, I was doing one of our free doxy calls, and we talked to a patient about IVF, and were talking about the natural cycle, the mini and the regular she. I had no idea that there was any other option except what I had been told and what I had done, where she'd done full stem, PGT, freeze, all come back for frozen transfer. That's right. That's all I offer. She was sitting here. I'm just sitting here stunned. I am stunned. Should I just I had no idea you're going to even talk about anything like this. I can't even get wrapped my head around it. Because she had come in with a preconceived notion of like, well, this is how it will be, and then mind blown.</p><p><strong><br>05:56</strong><br>Dr. John Gordon<br>Right? I mean, she was saying, I just had no idea.</p><p><strong><br>06:01</strong><br>Lynda McCollum<br>Which one works.</p><p><strong><br>06:02</strong><br>Dr. John Gordon<br>That's right. So mind blown. Right? So it's just the same thing, right? Passover last week, who knew, right? The ark of coming is real for the Bible. Who knew, right? With the death of Jesus, the movement didn't end. Right? Because Easter was coming and nobody knew it. Right. We look forward to the joy of Easter, right. On Sunday, even though you're I hope you're not busy. We're going to schedule away from it. Anybody who's thinking about surging on Saturday, just don't surge Miss Ovulation fair. You just stay away. Stay away.</p><p><strong><br>06:48</strong><br>Lynda McCollum<br>Go away until Monday.</p><p><strong><br>06:49</strong><br>Dr. John Gordon<br>That's right. All right. Well, at some point, we'll do our Facebook Friday. Outstanding in the field when it stopped raining. Right? And that'll be fun. Maybe next Friday. We'll see. We'll see if Mark can get a good Internet connection enough to do it.</p><p><strong><br>07:04</strong><br>Mark Mellinger<br>It's not on me.</p><p><strong><br>07:14</strong><br>Dr. John Gordon<br>Social media director for Southeast Infertility. It's not your fault. Right? It's definitely your fault.</p><p><strong><br>07:26</strong><br>Mark Mellinger<br>I want to be out there.</p><p><strong><br>07:27</strong><br>Speaker 4<br>I do. It'll be great.</p><p><strong><br>07:28</strong><br>Dr. John Gordon<br>All right? Wish you all a happy and healthy Easter weekend. We'll see you don't eat too many. Have you ever had those? We had the church. We had the peeps eating contesting, right? I remember, like, one of my son's friends, I think he ate, like 15.</p><p><strong><br>07:47</strong><br>Lynda McCollum<br>How long did it take before he starts?</p><p><strong><br>07:49</strong><br>Dr. John Gordon<br>I didn't see him throw up, but I was thinking, this could end really badly.</p><p><strong><br>07:54</strong><br>Lynda McCollum<br>My grandkids all love those peeps.</p><p><strong><br>07:57</strong><br>Mark Mellinger<br>The fruit punched ones look interesting. Those are a new innovation. I don't love peeps, but the fruit punch ones, look, I would try one.</p><p><strong><br>08:05</strong><br>Speaker 4<br>Just for a taste.</p><p><strong><br>08:09</strong><br>Dr. John Gordon<br>Like the orange circus peanuts.</p><p><strong><br>08:15</strong><br>Lynda McCollum<br>I don't know that I can remember not getting very much candy when I float. I wouldn't eat it because it's candy.</p><p><strong><br>08:21</strong><br>Dr. John Gordon<br>There you go. All right, well, we know who's going to be eating the grandkids Easter basket this week. You all have a wonderful weekend and we'll see you next week. Bye.</p>",

Yeah, but I'm just saying you have to get them through quickly. But it's funny that way. They're like, wow, it's all these people going through. Nobody wants to eat a restaurant.

No facebook friday.</p><p><strong><br>00:34</strong><br>Lynda McCollum<br>I felt lonely and abandoned.</p><p><strong><br>00:38</strong><br>Dr. John Gordon<br>Well, Mark and I were were in Florida.</p><p><strong><br>00:41</strong><br>Lynda McCollum<br>You were?</p><p><strong><br>00:41</strong><br>Dr. John Gordon<br>We were in Florida. So, yeah, went down to Florida. Went to Florida. I never wore shorts. I never went swimming.</p><p><strong><br>00:51</strong><br>Lynda McCollum<br>I.</p><p><strong><br>00:54</strong><br>Dr. John Gordon<br>Never was really outside very much.</p><p><strong><br>00:57</strong><br>Lynda McCollum<br>To go any of the spring practice.</p><p><strong><br>00:58</strong><br>Dr. John Gordon<br>Baseball games, major league zero, none of that. Right.</p><p><strong><br>01:01</strong><br>Mark Mellinger<br>What were we doing, mark? It was ditto. We were literally working at a conference.</p><p><strong><br>01:05</strong><br>Dr. John Gordon<br>That's right. We were at the Ligoner national conference at Ligoner ministries, the teaching ministry of r. C. Sproul, who came out of Pittsburgh back in the 70s when he actually started this teaching ministry in 1973, got approval of his presbyterian to start this. And it was a so it's interesting. When he started his ministry, and it was to explain biblical issues to the laypeople, he actually was one of first to adopt initially these audio cassettes, and they would send these up, and then if you did, they went to vcr, Mark, before anybody had vcrs. Ligoner would provide churches with the machine, like the three quarter inch tape machine, and they had teaching things on that tape. It was like the big old fat. It was interesting.</p><p><strong><br>01:51</strong><br>Mark Mellinger<br>Well, the three quarter these were huge vcrs.</p><p><strong><br>01:55</strong><br>Dr. John Gordon<br>Anyway, it's a national conference that the a and EC has exhibited for a couple of years down there, and it was very interesting. First of all, mark was swarmed by little kids wanting the NADC gum.</p><p><strong><br>02:08</strong><br>Mark Mellinger<br>True.</p><p><strong><br>02:10</strong><br>Dr. John Gordon<br>I walk over there and I'm like adolescents and preteens grabbing gum, but there's nobody else talking about we have people coming up saying, our church has done this, our daughter's done this. Current patients, past patients, successful patients. It's great, right?</p><p><strong><br>02:33</strong><br>Mark Mellinger<br>It was great. Yeah, it really was an experience you.</p><p><strong><br>02:36</strong><br>Dr. John Gordon<br>Had when I took you to the SRM meeting and you got into it.</p><p><strong><br>02:42</strong><br>Lynda McCollum<br>But she's lucky.</p><p><strong><br>02:44</strong><br>Dr. John Gordon<br>She's lucky. Let me just tell you about the ADC. That's right, exactly.</p><p><strong><br>03:02</strong><br>Lynda McCollum<br>Can I go with you guys next year, then?</p><p><strong><br>03:04</strong><br>Mark Mellinger<br>Yeah, you would do terrific. You do terrific.</p><p><strong><br>03:07</strong><br>Dr. John Gordon<br>It's actually going to be over more of the weekend next year at a nice resort that mark has been with the gospel coalition, having a big conference. Yeah. So it's great. I mean, it was really a lot of fun. We really enjoyed it.</p><p><strong><br>03:21</strong><br>Lynda McCollum<br>It was really spread the word about embryo adoption.</p><p><strong><br>03:23</strong><br>Dr. John Gordon<br>Spread the word about embryo adoption.</p><p><strong><br>03:25</strong><br>Lynda McCollum<br>It sounds like the words getting out because it has so many people that knew about it.</p><p><strong><br>03:29</strong><br>Dr. John Gordon<br>It is yeah, it's interesting. A lot of people are like, well, we crowds our patients here sometimes who come to us from out of town. We love watching Linda on Facebook Friday. I would never say, we love seeing you on Facebook Friday. We love watching Linda on Facebook Friday. Now, I'm Linda's assistant, but for these patients who are interested in great option, we actually said that they can certainly do one of the free docs of calls and learn more about it or see if it would be right for them. And it was just great. It was a great conference to be to participate in, and it was wonderful. I think our field obviously has a lot of ethical dilemmas. One of the guys came up, really nice guy from Florida, and he said, I wrote as part of I.</p><p><strong><br>04:14</strong><br>Mark Mellinger<br>Think he was getting a master's event, southern Seminary. I think that's right.</p><p><strong><br>04:19</strong><br>Dr. John Gordon<br>He wrote this whole thing about the ethics of IVF and issues that, from an ethical standpoint, great comedy, the paper. It's just interesting to have those discussions. I think the key is that you got to be open to have those discussions. I think that's the other thing. If you don't open up a discussion about this, then the patients will just find themselves down the road and not understanding, how did I get in this place where I have 27 frozen embryos and we don't know what to do? We don't want that to happen, right? We don't know. It's awesome. Just awesome. You stayed here in Mansa Ford. I did talk to everybody every day. There's nothing to do with fertility. If you're looking for fertility advice, you might as well just stop listening. We love southwest, right? I love flying southwest. Okay. And I stand by southwest.</p><p><strong><br>05:23</strong><br>Dr. John Gordon<br>Their problems they had over with the bad weather in the winter storm or not. We fly southwest from Nashville to Orlando. We land Orlando airport. Mark drove, but we land Orlando. I'm like, this is such a happy airport. I like this airport. Telling Alison it's fun. You get off the plane, and you have to take the monorail back to the main terminal. It's like it's already being at a theme park, right? This is great. It was, like, late afternoon on Wednesday. Okay. I really like this airport. It brings back happy memories of taking the kids Disney alive. We fly out on Saturday. Totally different experience. It was a madhouse. I mean, it was insane. Never seen it that busy. I guess it's spring break or something, but it was I mean, I don't really get like, claustrophobic and kind of anxiety issues, but, man, I will say I was feeling I was just feeling that little bit of tightness and little bit of album.</p><p><strong><br>06:39</strong><br>Dr. John Gordon<br>How are you feeling about your airport, dad? I have to look into flight into sanford executive airport on the legion.</p><p><strong><br>06:50</strong><br>Mark Mellinger<br>I have done that. I have done that. And it's actually very convenient.</p><p><strong><br>06:55</strong><br>Dr. John Gordon<br>The only problem is if you only have one airplane and that one breaks, then there's just no flight. Anyway, that was my impression. I say, well, this is actually back designed to do with fertility when we go through cycles because we batch patients like, oh, wow, so crowded day. I go, well, because everyone's kind of marching through their cycles together, so we won't let anybody wait and for it to be, like, horribly crowded. It's funny, they're like, oh, my gosh, I've never seen this many people here in the waiting area. We do want people to get through. I don't ever feel like it's a cattle call because of that. Yeah, but I'm just saying you have to get them through quickly. But it's funny that way. They're like, wow, it's all these people going through. Nobody wants to eat a restaurant. No one's eating, right?</p><p><strong><br>07:47</strong><br>Mark Mellinger<br>That's right.</p><p><strong><br>07:51</strong><br>Dr. John Gordon<br>Anyway, so final four. I think all our brackets are busted, but I have mark has the bracket.</p><p><strong><br>07:57</strong><br>Lynda McCollum<br>Yeah.</p><p><strong><br>07:57</strong><br>Mark Mellinger<br>I can't imagine who's going to win. I mean, I don't think anybody has nothing about basketball. Yeah.</p><p><strong><br>08:04</strong><br>Dr. John Gordon<br>All right.</p><p><strong><br>08:05</strong><br>Mark Mellinger<br>I can't imagine.</p><p><strong><br>08:11</strong><br>Dr. John Gordon<br>Could be the Huskies year. Could be Yukon Huskies. We'll see. That's right. All right, so next week maybe we'll do a field trip to depending on the weather. Okay. Stay tuned and wish you all the very best. Enjoy the end of March Madness and.</p><p><strong><br>08:27</strong><br>Lynda McCollum<br>See you next Friday.</p><p><strong><br>08:28</strong><br>Dr. John Gordon<br>See you next Friday. It's time for league and air. All right, bye.</p>",

Unfortunately, cancellations or delays of embryo transfer cycles during fertility treatment can sometimes be among those unpleasant hiccups.</p><p>There can be many reasons for cancelling the embryo transfer portion of a cycle, including:</p><p>-A woman’s body is unresponsive to the medical protocol.</p><p>-A fibroid or polyp develops and needs to be removed.</p><p>-The uterine lining just doesn’t develop properly.</p><p>-A woman’s body is overly responsive to the medical protocol.</p><p>But if any of these happen to you, all hope is not lost. A successful transfer cycle may still be very possible, and could be just ahead in the near future.

In the video below, he takes some time to reflect on a few things he finds unbelievable (in a good way) now that he’s had time to settle in. Plus, he points out a few things patients have told him they find unbelievable about Southeastern Fertility (again, in a good way). The list of unbelievables:</p><p>1. That he’s here! Dr. Gordon is amazed God led him to a life-affirming fertility center where he is able to practice in a way that aligns with his faith.</p><p>2. How nice everyone is here. Yes, Dr. Gordon loved his patients and practice in the Washington, D.C. area. But he’s been genuinely amazed at the kindness and laid back nature of the folks here in East Tennessee.</p><p>3. That we do Natural Cycle IVF. Patients have been relieved to find an affordable, ethical option for IVF that doesn’t involve all the headaches of fertility medications. Southeastern Fertility is pleased to be able to provide NC IVF.</p><p>4. That we listen to patients! We want to hear your story and offer personalized care that aligns with your values. Some patients have told us this can be relatively rare in the fertility industry.</p><p>5. That you actually see the doctor here! Again, many patients have been surprised that their physician is the one they’re able to actually see and consult with. We have terrific nurses who assist with that, but our doctors are involved in every aspect of the treatment process.</p><p>6. That Dr. Gordon’s family is here! There were certainly a lot of unknowns when the Gordons contemplated moving to Knoxville, and many family considerations to digest, including one child still in high school. Now that it’s happened, Dr. Gordon says the move has been a blessing for his entire family.</p><p><em>To schedule your free 15-minute telemedicine consult with Co-Director Dr. John Gordon, call 865-777-0088 or </em><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://south-eastern.onrender.com/free-consultations.html\"><em>click here</em></a><em>.

Though research on this has come to varying conclusions, there is evidence suggesting a biopsy can better prepare the lining for embryo implantation. Southeastern Fertility Co-Director Dr. John Gordon compares this to pruning rose bushes, asserting that there may be something in the reparative process that enhances chances of a successful implantation and pregnancy.</p></li><li><p>To test endometrial receptivity. Sometimes our medical team will advise endometrial biopsies for patients who we feel probably should be experiencing successful embryo transfers yet are not.

    "description_html": "<p>Sometimes one last shot at a dream is all you have. And sometimes that’s enough. Jon and Kristie Weaver are living proof.</p><p>Jon and Kristie’s romance started years ago amid the sun and the sand. “Jon and I met at a sand volleyball game at a friend’s house in 2009. He played. I watched,” Kristie shares.&nbsp;</p><p>Their relationship blossomed from there. Eventually, it led to wedding bells. Both Jon and Kristie longed to expand their joy by adding children to their home. So they became concerned after a year of trying to get pregnant with no success. “Our diagnosis was unexplained infertility,” Kristie says. “ I was 37 at the time, which made me ‘advanced maternal age’, I soon found out.“&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>They weren’t sure exactly what to do next, but they knew where to go to look for answers. “We were referred to Southeastern Fertility for a fibroid removal in 2016.&nbsp; It only made sense to return to Southeastern Fertility when we struggled to get pregnant,” Jon and Kristie say. “After several cycles of IVF with Southeastern Fertility, we ended up getting pregnant using our last frozen embryo.&nbsp; We found out at nine weeks that the embryo split and we were having twins!”</p><p>Indeed, that’s just what happened. A few months later, Kristie gave birth to Jones and Jackson. “They are the most amazing twins in the world.&nbsp; They love to eat, laugh, listen to music, and play,” Jon and Kristie say. “They light up every room they enter and have filled everyone’s heart to the top with love and laughter.”</p><p>It sure wasn’t an easy road to get to Jones and Jackson, but Jon and Kristie are glad they hung on during their sometimes white-knuckle ride. Having the Southeastern Fertility team by their side lightened their anxiety during the most intense stretches. “The doctor, the nurses and the rest of the staff mean the world to us! I truly feel like we are family,” Kristie says. “I always had a hand to hold if my husband had to work, a shoulder to cry on if things didn’t go as planned, and words of encouragement when I needed it the most.&nbsp; If they weren’t here I probably wouldn’t have my boys, and I would be missing out on all of the wonderful relationships I made during the whole experience.”</p><p>If this had been a baseball game, you could say the Weavers were down to their last strike with two outs in the bottom of the ninth. And then- a dramatic home run! It’s the kind of Cinderella story we at Southeastern Fertility can’t believe we get to be a part of. And yet, we’re mindful that we’re not ultimately the ones in charge of it all. Jon and Kristie agree, summing it up this way: “We cannot say enough nice things about our experience at Southeastern Fertility. The knowledge, skill, and expertise combined with the love, empathy, and encouragement of the staff made us feel like we were right where God wanted us.”</p><p><em>To schedule your free 15-minute telemedicine consult with Co-Director Dr. John Gordon, call 865-777-0088 or&nbsp;</em><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://south-eastern.onrender.com/free-consultations.html\"><em>click here</em></a><em>.

Well, often those undergoing fertility treatment are understandably anxious. They’ve already been through the long, arduous struggle of infertility. Now the prospect of treatment finally offers some hope!</p><p>It’s no wonder, then, that when some patients run into uncertainty at any point in their treatment, a sense of panic can set in. After all, a lot of family-building dreams are riding on this. The stakes couldn’t be higher, right?</p><p>Common examples of such uncertainty would include not receiving a call with ultrasound or lab results precisely when expected, or waiting to hear back from the medical team after emailing a question concerning a treatment plan.</p><p>At Southeastern Fertility, we understand this anxiety. It’s always our goal to respond quickly to patient inquiries and concerns. Sometimes, though, there will be factors beyond anyone’s control that cause delays. In these moments, Dr. Gordon says to trust the process.</p><p>Rarely, if ever, will these tense moments affect the ultimate outcome of your treatment. That’s very important to keep in mind, and should provide some reassurance. Of course, if your treatment is with Southeastern Fertility and you have a nagging concern for which a response seems urgent, you are always welcome to contact Dr. Gordon directly at dr.gordon@southeasternfertility.org.</p><p>Dr. Gordon and Lynda unpack this topic a little more in the short video below.</p><p><em>To schedule your free 15-minute telemedicine consult with Co-Director Dr. John Gordon, call 865-777-0088 or </em><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://south-eastern.onrender.com/free-consultations.html\"><em>click here</em></a><em>.

    "description_html": "<p>You never know just what sorts of great finds you’ll discover at a home improvement store. Sometimes, as in the case of Keith and Amanda McFarland, such finds can even be life-changing. Lowe’s, where they were both working back in 2006, was where they first connected.&nbsp;</p><p>The relationship blossomed into marriage. Surely children and a home with a white picket fence would follow, right? “We wanted to have children to complete our family, to experience life as parents, and to give and provide in a loving Christian environment,” Amanda says. But it wasn’t that simple. Amanda and Keith ran into the heartbreaking roadblock of infertility.</p><p>“We couldn’t figure out why we weren’t getting pregnant, what was taking so long, and why everyone else we knew was getting pregnant so easily,” Keith and Amanda remember. So they started looking for answers.</p><p>Their search led the McFarlands to Southeastern Fertility. They knew they were in good hands, but there were still several steps ahead on the road to having children. Both Keith and Amanda had surgery to improve their chances of conceiving. They also tried IUIs (intrauterine inseminations) without success. Finally, they opted for IVF.</p><p>That was when the McFarlands say they saw God’s hand powerfully at work. After two cycles of IVF with Southeastern Fertility, they’ve finally welcomed two children into the family: River, 2, was born in 2018. Emmaline, just 4 months old, followed in 2020. “River is 100 miles per hour from sun up to sun down. He gives the best hugs and kisses,” Amanda shares. “Emmaline loves to be held and talked to. She has the best smile, is starting to laugh, and has some killer eyelashes.”</p><p>Keith and Amanda half-jokingly sum up life as parents this way: “They both have stolen our hearts, and all of our time.” And they wouldn’t trade it for the world. Neither would their extended family, which loves seeing Keith and Amanda enjoying their long-held dream of parenthood and the happiness River and Emmaline have brought to their lives.</p><p>Looking back on their experience, the McFarlands feel blessed to have been connected with the team at Southeastern Fertility. “They were all very understanding and always there for us when we needed something,” Keith and Amanda say. “If Southeastern Fertility wasn’t here, we may not have been able to experience all of this wonderful madness and a love so big for our children. God has been good to us and we’re thankful that He pointed us in their direction.”</p><p>Dr. John Gordon and the entire Southeastern Fertility family are thrilled for Keith and Amanda, and for so many others whose dreams have come to life through our work. We’re privileged to walk alongside infertile couples every day in a way that’s hopeful and compassionate. An old slogan from none other than Lowe’s actually captures our spirit well: Let’s build something together.</p><p><em>To learn more about Southeastern Fertility, including our mission, values and team,&nbsp;</em><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://south-eastern.onrender.com/about-us.html\"><em>click here.</em></a>&nbsp;<em>To learn more about IVF with Southeastern Fertility,&nbsp;</em><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://south-eastern.onrender.com/ivf.html\"><em>click here.</em></a></p>",

    "description_html": "<p>Let’s be honest. Most high school romances, well, just don’t work out. Bring together two immature, relatively inexperienced people, and it’s no wonder the odds are stacked against them. That’s why high school sweethearts who turn into lifelong loves seem so novel. But it still happens. Just look at Southeastern Fertility couple T.J. and Megan Seiber.</p><p>“Megan and I first met in gym class our freshman year,” T.J. says. “We began dating during the summer going into our senior year and haven’t looked back since!”&nbsp;</p><p>In fact, they actually did a lot of looking forward, right from the start. Both planned to become education majors in college and commit to a life of serving young people through teaching. They knew that wouldn’t be limited to the classroom, either. Children of their own were definitely in T.J. and Megan’s plans for the future.</p><p>“We loved watching our students grow, but, shortly after marriage, we knew we were ready to watch our own children grow,” the Seibers share. “Because of Megan’s previous PCOS diagnosis we knew that starting a family might take a little longer than normal, but were not expecting to be faced with infertility.”</p><p>However, after a year and a half of trying on their own without success, Megan’s doctor suggested they start taking a deeper dive to look for answers. That was when T.J. and Megan turned to Southeastern Fertility. “With the help of Southeastern Fertility we discovered that we had male factor infertility as well,” Megan and T.J. remember. “What we thought would take a few months to achieve ended up taking over three years.”</p><p>The infertility diagnosis came with so many agonizing questions that no one could answer. Having children seemed to come so easily for most young couples. Why did this have to happen to <em>them</em>?</p><p>Excruciating as the reality of their infertility was, Megan and T.J. never doubted they were in good hands. “The more we found out about Southeastern Fertility, the more we were drawn to the office,” they say. “We chose Southeastern Fertility because of their beliefs that every embryo is a life, the incredible success rates, the kindness of the office staff, and the respect that was shown to us during our initial consultation.”&nbsp;</p><p>Best of all, their treatment with Southeastern Fertility produced the long-hoped-for result: T.J. and Megan’s daughter, Carter Ray, who’s now six months old. “Carter is so full of joy. She has all the sass of a 16-year-old packed into her six-month-old self,” the Seibers say. “Her dramatic facial expressions will always show you how she is feeling. She loves to swing, chew on her lovie, and eat broccoli.&nbsp; We never&nbsp;fully realized how big the holes in our hearts were until God filled them with Carter.”</p><p>Looking back on their long road, T.J. and Megan see Southeastern Fertility as not just a medical clinic. They see it as a place of hope where the entire team really listens and cares. “If it were not for Southeastern Fertility, we could still be working to start our family,” they share. “We absolutely love all of the office staff and nurses. We feel listened to every time we come in, and our questions are always answered. At the start of our pregnancy there were some concerning issues, and they went above and beyond to make sure our baby was safe and continued to grow.”&nbsp;</p><p>It’s humbling to be part of this inspiring new chapter in T.J. and Megan’s still-going-since-high-school relationship. After all, we’re not the ones writing the story. “Carter is more than we ever prayed for. We go to bed every night and wake up every morning full of gratitude for our little girl,” T.J. and Megan say. “Her story has blessed many of our friends and family and showed how God is always in control and is always on time. Hindsight truly is 20/20, and we now know that every hiccup was just part of God’s plan that led us to our daughter.”&nbsp;</p><p><em>To learn more about Southeastern Fertility, including our mission, values and team, </em><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://south-eastern.onrender.com/about-us.html\"><em>click here.</em></a> <em>To learn more about IVF with Southeastern Fertility, </em><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://south-eastern.onrender.com/ivf.html\"><em>click here.</em></a><br></p>",

Since we are very comfortable with freezing unfertilized eggs we recommend that patients carefully consider this decision so as to avoid the difficulties inherent in deciding what to do with frozen embryos once a couple no longer wishes to use them to have additional children. Although the National Embryo Donation Center (NEDC) has matched thousands of donated embryos with recipients, there are estimated to be over 1 million frozen embryos stored in IVF clinics across the United States. At Southeastern Fertility we are committed to helping resolve the problem inherent in storing these embryos indefinitely by avoiding the creation of too many surplus embryos."

A recent segment on the <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.today.com/video/abandoned-embryos-from-fertility-treatment-create-ethical-dilemma-75946565952\">Today Show</a> (and another featuring yours truly on <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.wbir.com/article/news/health/east-tennessee-doctors-working-to-curb-national-embryo-abandonment-nationwide/51-c842c1ff-05ae-4e7d-b074-f7e381b57bb8?fbclid=IwAR0X7TP-piPMs7WxC6tFqGwgem9CsK49pQphDC-pwMYI8uMjcVggj4bZm2Q\">local TV</a>) highlighted this very issue and suggested that if we do not take steps to address this issue, then it is only a matter of time before the government decides to address it for us.</p><p><strong>FAQ 24.  How many eggs should I fertilize?</strong></p><p>Our recommendation to all patients is that they consider fertilizing only as many eggs as embryos that they are willing to transfer either now or in a future FET cycle. Since we are very comfortable with freezing unfertilized eggs we recommend that patients carefully consider this decision so as to avoid the difficulties inherent in deciding what to do with frozen embryos once a couple no longer wishes to use them to have additional children. Although the National Embryo Donation Center (NEDC) has matched thousands of donated embryos with recipients, there are estimated to be over 1 million frozen embryos stored in IVF clinics across the United States. At Southeastern Fertility we are committed to helping resolve the problem inherent in storing these embryos indefinitely by avoiding the creation of too many surplus embryos.</p>",
